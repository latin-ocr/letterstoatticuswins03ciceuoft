LETTERS To ATTicus xm. Qla

I am in such a hurry to send what Ι have written
to Varro, as you suggested, that I have sent it already
to Rome to be copied. If you like, you shall have
it at once. For 1 wrote to my copyist telling them
to give your people leave to copy, if you liked.
Please keep it, however, till I see you. You are
generally most careful to do so, when Ι have told
you. I was nearly foi-getting to say that Caerellia,
inspired- of course by love of philosophy, is copying
from your people13 she has those very books De
Finibus. I assure you, so far as it is humanly possible
to affirm anything, that she did not get it from mine,
for my copy was never out of my sight. So far were
my people from making two copies, that they could
scarcely make up one. However, Ι am not finding any
fault in your people, and 1 hope you will not either,
for 1 omitted to say that I did not want the books
circulated yet. Dear me, how Ι do harp on trifles.
The fact is I have nothing of importance to say.

I agree about Dolabella. My co—heirs Ι will meet
at Tusculum, as you suggest. As to Caesar’s arrival,
Balbus has written that he won¹t be here till the
first of August. It is good news that Attica’s
attack gets slighter and slighter and that she is
bearing it cheerfully. As to that idea of ours, about
which Ι am quite as eager as you are, so far as Ι
know anything about the man, I appi-ove of him,
his family, and his fortune. What is most important
is that, though I'do not know him himself,I hear
very well of him, even quite recently from Scrofa.
If it is of any importanee, one may add that heis even
better bred than his father. So we will speak of it
when we meet, and 1 am disposed to approve. For
in addition, as 1 think you know, I am with good
reason and long have been fonder of his father than
either you or he himself is aware.
