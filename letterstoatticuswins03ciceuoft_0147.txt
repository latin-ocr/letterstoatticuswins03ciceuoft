LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 12-13, 14

think very highly, to Brutus as you advised, and you
have told me he was gratified. So Ι must assign
the Academica to Varro. The speakers in it are men
of birth to be sure, but not scholars, and talk above

auction of Brinnius' estate. He tells me I was unani-
mously given the direction of it. They evidently
thought 1 should be in town or at Tusculum on the
24th. So please tell your friend S. Vettius, my co-
heir, or Labienus, to put the sale off for a while3
and that I shall be at Tusculum about July 7th.
You have Eros to help with Piso. Let us throw our-
selves heart and soul into the purchase of Scapula's
gardens. The time is drawing near.

much like you to tell me how you knew Varro wanted
it: and one thing at any rate Ι want to know, who
