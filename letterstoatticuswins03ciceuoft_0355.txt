LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 15

seen him in my house; and then, when Ι asked
politely what he wanted, he said he wanted Atticus.
But the iusolence of the queen herself, when she
was in her villa across the river, Ι cannot mention
without great indignation. So no dealings with
them. They don’t credit me with any spirit or even
any feelings at all.

My departure from Italy Ι see is hindered by Eros’
management of my affairs. For, although from the
balances he made on April 5 I ought to have plenty
of cash, I have to borrow, and I think the receipts
from those paying concerns are set aside for the
shrine. But I have given Tiro orders about this, and
am sending him to Rome on purpose. I did not want
to add to your worries. The more moderate in his
demands my son is, the more am Ι concerned about
him. For he has not mentioned this point to me,
the person of all others to whom of course he
ought to have mentioned it; but in a letter to
Tiro he said I had sent him nothing since April 1,
which was the end of his finaneial year. Now Ι
know that you, with your usual amiability, have
always agreed and indeed thought that among
other things my dignity demanded that he should
be treated not only liberally, but even with excessive
and extravagant liberality. So Ι should like you to
see that he has a bill of exchange for his annual
allowanee payable at Athens. I would not trouble
you, if I could manage it through anyone else. Eros,
of course, will pay you. That is why Ι have sent
Tiro. Please see about it and let me know if you
have any views on the point.
