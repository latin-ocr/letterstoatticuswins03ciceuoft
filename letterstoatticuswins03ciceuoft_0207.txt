LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 40

XL

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

Is that so ? Does Brutus really say Caesar is going Tusculum,

over to the right party? That is good news. But Aug. 7 or 5,
where will he find them, unless, perhaps, he hangs B.C. 45
himself? But how foolish it is of Brutus! Where,
then, does that masterpiece of yours, which Ι saw
in the Parthenon, the tree of Brutus’ family from
Ahala and Brutus, come in ? 1 But what can he do ?
It is excellent to hear that not even the man who
began the whole criminal business has a good word
to say for young Quintus. Indeed, Ι was beginning
to be afraid that even Brutus was fond of him; for
in his letter to me he said, ‘⁴ But I wish you could
have had a taste of his tales.'’ But when we meet,
³8 Ιῖἷοοιζνίῖξτ, what do you advise? Shall I fly to meet
him or stay where l am? For my part 1 am glued
to my books, and I don’t want to receive him here.
Ι hear his father has gone to-day to Saxa Rubra 2 to
meet him in a sury. He was so extraordinarily
enraged against him that Ι remonstrated with him.
But Ι arn capable of acting the “giddy goat’' too.
So it rests with the future. Do you please see what
you think about my movements and everything else.
If you can see the way to-morrow, let me know
early.
