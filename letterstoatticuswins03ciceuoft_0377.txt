LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 26

my messenger tells me he brought you a letter, too,
from Brutus, and that it was forwarded to you from
Tusculum.

1 have arranged my journeys so that 1 shall be at
Puteoli on the 7th of July; for, though I am in a
great hurry, I mean to take every care humanly
possible in my voyage. Please relieve M. Aelius of
his anxiety. Tell him I thought that on a few feet at
the far end of the land there might be some sort of
claims, and those only underground. Also that Ι have
not the slightest desire for it, and that 1 don't value
water at that price.¹ But, as you suggested, do it
as mildly as possible, rather to relieve him of anxiety
than to suggest that I am in the least annoyed.
Again, about that debt of Tullius: speak to Cascel-
lius frankly. It is a small matter, but 1 am glad you
attended to it. There was too much trickery about
it: and, if he had cheated me at all, which he very
nearly did if you had not been too sharp for him, 1
should have been very much annoyed. So, whatever
happens, Ι would rather the matter were broken off.
Remember that an eighth share of the houses of
Tullius near the temple of Strenia is due to Cae-
rellia, and see that it is conveyed to her at the
highest price bid at the auction. 1 think that was
some 3,000 guineas.2

If there is any news, and, even if you foresee
anything you think likely to happen, 1 should like
you to write to me as often as possible. To Varro
underground water-pipes on property of Aelius adjoining his
own, and was now disclaiming it3 or Aelius had been com-
missioned to buy property for Cicero on which there was a
disputed claim to such pipes‚ and Cicero refuses to purchase
on that ground. Servitus above is used in the technical legal

sense of an “ easement '’ or Iiability on property.
² 380 sestertia. On this debt cf. Atc. ΧΠ. 51.
