LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 10

on that first day on the Capitol ¹ that the Senate should
be summoned thither by the praetors? Ye gods!
what might we not have accomplished then, when
all the loyalists were rejoicing, and even the half
loyal, while the knaves were crushed. You blame
the Liberalia.2 What could have been done then?
We were done for already. Do you remember you
exclaimed our cause was lost if the funeral took
place? But he was even burned in the forum and
a moving oration was delivered in his praise‚ and
slaves and paupers were incited to attack our houses
with torches. And the end of it all is that they dare to
sayz “Are you going to oppose Caesar’s will ? ” Such
things as these Ι cannot bear. So I am thinking of
shifting from land to land. But your land⁸ is too
ex osed.

{133 your siekness left you entirely now? So
far as 1 can guess from your letters it has. 1
return to the Tebassi‚ Scaevae, and Frangones.⁴ Do
you suppose they will have any confidence in their
homesteads, while we have any power? They have
found us to have less courage than they expected.
1 suppose we must hold them lovers of peace and
not a gang of brigands. But, when I wrote to you
of Curtilius aud Sextilianus' farm, I wrote of Censo-
rinus, Messalla, Plancus, Postumus, and all such cases
It were better to have perished when he was slain—
though it would never have corne to that 5—than to
see such things.

Octavius came to Naples on the 18th of April.
There Balbus met him the next morning, and the

⁴ Veterans of Qaesar’s army, who had had lands of the
chmgiedgtlffolssirl'glgsvetrlnae tthkcgn republican party would have
preva11e‹l‚ if they had been bolder after Caesar’s death.
