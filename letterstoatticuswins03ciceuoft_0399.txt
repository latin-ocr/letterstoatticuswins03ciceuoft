LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 4

told us that Philo, a freedman of Pompey, and Hi-
larus, one of his own, had come from Sextus with a
letter for the consuls, “or whatever they call them.'’
He read us a copy to see what we thought of it.
There were a few odd expressions, but in other
respects it was sufficiently dignified and not aggres-
sive. We only thought it better to make an addition
of “Praetors, Tribunes of the People, and Senate”
to the simple address to the “ Consuls,” for fear they
should not publish a letter sent to them. They say
that Sextus has been at Carthage with only one
legion, and that he received the news about Caesar
on the very day that he took the town of Barea.
After the capture there were great rejoicings and a
change of sentiment, and people flocked to him from
every side, but he returned to the six legions he
had left in lower Spain. He has written to Libo
himself saying it is all nothing to him if he cannot
get home. The upshot of his demands is, that all
the armies everywhere should be disbanded. That
is all about Sextus.

I have been making enquiries in every direction
about the Buthrotians, and discover nothing. Some
say the land-grabbers were cut to pieces, others that
Plancus pocketed the money and fled, leaving them
in the lurch. So I don‘t see how I can find out what
there is in it, unless I get a letter at once.

The route to Brundisium, about which I was hesi-
tating, seems to be out of the question. They say
the troops are arriving there. But the voyage from
here has some suspicion of danger, sol have made
up my mind to sail in company with Brutus. I found
him better prepared than Ι had heard he was. For
both he and Domitius have quite good two-banked
galleys, and there are also some good ships belonging
