LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. l6e-f

what the consuls decreed in accordance with Caesar's
decrees and promises, lies in your hands. It will be
doing me a favour than which none could be greater.
Although I hope that by the time you receive this
letter you will have granted me the petition 1 made
in my former letter, still I shall not cease from
asking until 1 have news that you have done what
Ι am looking foi-ward to with great hope. Then I
trust 1 shall write a different kind of letter, and pay
my thanks for your exeeeding kindness. If that
comes to pass 1 would have you think that you
have not so much put Atticus, in spite of the
huge sum of money he has at stake, under an ob-
ligation, as myself, who take an equal interest in
the matter.

stake. l know the willingness with which you help
your friends and your friends help you. You can
render us much assistance with Plancus. I know
the kindness of your heart3 I know how welcome
you are to your friends. There is no one who can
help us more than you in this case. And the case is
as sound as a case ought to be which the consuls
have decided on the advice of their couneil, when
they had the right of decision conferred on thcm by
statute and by senatorial decree. Still to us the

whole case seems to lie in the generosity of your
