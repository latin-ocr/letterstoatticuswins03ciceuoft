LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XIII. 51-52

clcmno TO ATTlcus, GREETlNG.

It escaped my memory to send you a copy of the Tusculum,
letter Ι sent to Caesar at the time. lt was not, Aug. 26,
as you suspect, that Ι was ashamed of showing it ac, 45
it to you, for sear 1 should seem too much of a
flatterer; nor, Ι assure you, did Ι write otherwise
than Ι should to an equal. For 1 have got a high
opinion of those books of his, as Ι told you when
we met. So 1 wrote without flattery, and yet 1
think he will read it with great pleasure.

At last 1 have full news of Attica3 so please
congratulate her again. Tell me all about Tigellius
and that too as soon as possible; for 1 am feeling
anxious. There is one thing Ι must mention. Young
Quintus is coming to-morrow; but, whether to me
or to you,1 don't know. He wrote to me he was
coming to Rome on the 25th. 1 have sent someone
to invite him here. Though to be sure 1 must go
to Rome now, for sear Caesar may forestall me.
