LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 19

should have been a mere lay figure. That suits
admirably when the characters are persons of olden
times; and that is what Heraclides often did in his
works3 and Ι myself did so in my six books De
Republica. It is the same, too, in my three books
De Oratore, of which Ι think very highly; in thern,
too, the characters were such that I could properly
keep silent. For the speakers are Crassus, An-
tonius, old Catulus, his brother C. Julius, Cotta and
Sulpicius; and the conversation is supposed to take
place when I was a boy, so that I could have no part
in it. But in a modern work, Ι follow Aristotle's
practice: the conversation of the others is so put
forward as to leave him the principal part. 1
arranged the five books De Finibus so as to give
the Epicurean parts to L. Torquatus, the Stoic to
M. Cato, and the Peripate-tic to M. Piso. I thought
that could not make anybody jealous, as they were
all dead. This present work, the Academica, as you
know, 1 had shared between Catulus, Lucullus and
Hortensius. I must admit that the work did not
suit the characters3 for it was far too philosophical
for them to have ever dreamt of such things. So,
when Ι read your note about Varro, Ι jumped at it
as a godsend. Nothing could have been more appro-
priate for expounding the system of philosophy in
which he seems to be specially interested, and for
introducing a part which prevents me from seeming
to give my own cause the superiority. For the
views of Antiochus are very persuasive, and l have
put them carefully with all Antiochus' acuteness
and my own polished style, is I possess one. But
do you consider carefully, whether you think I ought
to dedicate the books to Varro. Some objections
occur to me; but of that when we meet.
