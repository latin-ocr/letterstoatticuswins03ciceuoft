LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XII. 33-34

Ι think, has divided up his property on the banks of
the Tiber into lots of so and so many acres with
fixed prices, which I don’t know. So write and tell
me, whatever you do.

1 am much disturbed about dear Attica’s ill-health,
it almost makes me sear it is somebody's fault. But
the good character of her tutor, the attention of her
doctor, and the carefulness of the whole household
in every way forbid me to entertain that suspicion.
So take care of her. Ι can write no more.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREE‘HNG.

Ι could be very comfortable here considering my Astura,
troubles even without Sicca—for Tiro is better ; but, [Uar-ck 30,
as you tell me to look out that I’m not caught, by ac, 45
which I am to understand you can’t fix a day for the
departure 1 mentioned, I thought the best thing
would be to go to Rome. That l see is your opinion
too. So to-morrow Ι shall go to Sicca'ssuburban place.

Then 1 think Ι will stay at your place at Ficulea, as
you suggest. The matters you have mentioned we
will investigate together, as Ι am coming. Your kind-
ness, diligence and good sense both in managing my
affairs and in forming plans and suggesting them in
your letters, goes to my beart wonderfully. How-
ever, if you do anything with Silius, even on the
very day of my arrival at Sicca's place, please let
me know, especially which part he wants to with-
draw. You say “the far end.’' Take care that is
not the very bit which, as you know, set me think-
ing about the thing at all. I am sending you a
letter of Hirtius’, which has just come. Ι 1; is kindly
expressed.
