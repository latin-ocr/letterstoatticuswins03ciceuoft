LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 19-20

1 persuaded her easily that what she asked was
not even lawful‚ besides being repugnant to me.
1f Ι see Antony, 1 will do my best for Buthrotum.

Ι come to your more recent letter, though 1 have
answered already about Servius. You say Ι make
much of Dolabella’s score. Well, 1 don’t see that
he could have made a greater one considering the
times and circumstances. However, all the credit
Ι give him Ι give in accordance with your letter.
But l agree with you that it would be still better,
if he would pay off my score.l Ι hope Brutus
will be at Astura. You praise me for not making
up my mind about leaving the country before Ι
see how things are going to turn out. 1 have
changed my mind: however 1 won’t do anything
until Ι see you. I am gratified at Attica’s thanking
me for her mother. I have put the whole house
and the store-rooms at her service and 1 am think-
ing of seeing her on the llth. Give Attica my
love. I will take great care of Pilia.

From Pompeii I came by sea to enjoy our friend Puteoli,
Lucullus' hospitality on the lOth about nine o’clock May 11, ac.
in the morning. As Ι disembarked, Ι received your 44
letter, which your messenger says was taken to
Cumae, dated the 7 th. 1 left Lucullus and reached
Puteoli about the same bour the next day. There
1 received two letters, dated one the 7th the other

instalment of Tullia’s dowry‚ which Dolabella had to
repay. 279
