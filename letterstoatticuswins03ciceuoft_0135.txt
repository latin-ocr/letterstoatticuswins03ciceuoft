LETTERS To ATTICUS XIII. 6-6a

against our will. So, as you say, we will arrange,
when we meet, how the matter is to be straightened
out. It is quite as well that you have seen the other
joint heirs.

You ask for my letter to Brutus. l have not a
copy: but there is one in existence and Tiro says
you ought to have it : and, so far as Ι recollect, 1 sent
you my answer along with his letter of reproof.
Please see that I am not troubled with serving on a

jury.

CICERO ΤΟ A'r'rlcus, GREE'rlNG.

The Tuditanus you mention, great-grandfather of Tusculum,
Hortensius, I had never heard of, and I thought it June 4,
was the son who was the ambassador, though he nc. 45
could not have been at the time. I take it as
certain that Mummius was at Corinth. For Spurius,
who died lately, often used to recite to me letters
Mummius wrote to his friends from Corinth in elever
verse. But I have no doubt he was a special legate
to his brother, not among the ten ambassadors.

Here is another point too that Ι have been taught,
that it was not the custom of our ancestors to
appoint among the ten ambassadors anyone who was
related to the generals, as we in ignorance of, or
rather in contempt sor, the soundest institutions did
in sending M. Lucullus and L. Murena and others
to L. Lucullus. But it was most natural that he
should be among the first of his brother’s legates.
What a lot of work you get through, attending to
points like this, managing my affairs and bestowing
nearly as much care on your own affairs as on mine Ξ
