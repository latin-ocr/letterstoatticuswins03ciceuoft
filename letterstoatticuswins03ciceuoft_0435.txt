LETTERS To ATTICUS XVI. 14

XIV

elei-:Ro TO A'rr1cus, GRERTING.

Ι have nothing whatever to write about. For, Arpinum,

when Ι was at Puteoli, there was something fresh middle ⁰f
about Octavian every day, and plenty of false N0v.,n.c. 44
reports about Antony. However, Ι had three
letters from you on the fifth, and Ι strongly agree
with what you said, that if Octavian has much
success, the tyrant’s proposals will receive stronger
confirmation than they did in the temple of Tellus,¹
and that will be against the interests of Brutus.
But if, on the other hand, he is conquered, you
see Antony will be intolerable3 so you don’t know
which you want. What a rascal Sestius' messenger
is! He said he would be in Rome the day after
he left Puteoli! You advise me to move slowly,
and I agree, though once I thought differently.
Ι am not influenced by Philippus or Marcellus;
for their position is different, or, if it is not, it
looks as though it were.2 But that youth, though
he has plenty of spirit, has little influence. How-
ever, see whether it would not be better for me
to be at Tusculum, if Ι should do right in being
there. Ι would rather be there; for I should get
all the news. Or had 1 better be here when
Antony comes?

But, as one thing suggests another‚³ Ι know that
what the Greeks call καθῆκον (duty), we call officium.

But why should you doubt whether the word fits
appropriately in political affairs? Don’t we say the

2 Marcellus was Oct-avian’e brother-in-law3 Philippus his
stepfather.

³ Apparently tho idea of “duty '⁹ was suggested by recte
just above, though it hardly bears that, meaning in this case.
