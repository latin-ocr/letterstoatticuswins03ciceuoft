LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 22

XXII

CICERO TO ATTICUS.

As soon as Ι learned from Pilia that she was Puteoli,
sending a messenger to you on the l5th, Ι scrawled May 14, Ec,
this bit of a note. First then 1 want you to 44
know that Ι am leaving here for Arpinum on
May l7th. So, if you have anything to send after
that, you must send it there: though 1 shall be
in Rome almost directly. For I want to scent
out as clearly as possible what is going to happen
before I come to town. However, Ι fear my sus-
picions are not far from the truth. For it is clear
enough what they are doing. My pupil,¹ who
dined with me to·day, is a warm admirer of the
man who was wounded by our Brutus: and, if
you want to know, Ι see quite clearly that they
are afraid of peace. This is the theme on which
they are always dwelling : that a most distinguished
person has been killed, that by his death the whole
state has been thrown into disorder; that his acts
will be null and void as soon as we have ceased
to fear3 that his clemency was his destruction,
and that, if he had not practised clemency, such
a thing could not have happened to him. I cannot
help thinking, then, that if Pompey comes with
a strong force, which is quite possible, there will
certainly be war. When I picture this and think
of it, I am disturbcd: for now we shall not have
the choice you had before. ’ For we have shown
our joy openly. Again they speak of us as ingrateS.
What you and many others did then certainly will
not be possible now. M ust I put in an appearance,

¹ Hirtius.
