LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 31-32

outside price and say how much I prefer them to
Drusus' gardens. Ι have never been in them; Ι
know Coponius' country house is old and not very
large and the wood a fine one; but Ι don't know
what either brings in, and that Ι think we ought to
know. But for me either of them should be
reckoned rather by my need than by the mai-ket
value. However please consider whether 1 can get
them or not. If I were to sell my claim on Faberius,
Ι should have no doubt about settling for Silius’
gardens even with ready money, if only he could be
induced to sell. If his are not for sale‚r1 should
have recourse to Drusus, even at the price Egnatius
said he asked. Hermogenes too can be a great
assistance to me in getting ready money. You must
not mind my being eager, one ought to be when
one is wanting to make a purchase. However I
won’t give way to my wishes and my grief so far as
not to be ruled by you.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREE‘MNG.

Egnatius has written to me. lf he has spoken to Astura,
you, write and tell me, for the matter can be March 28,
arranged most conveniently through him, and Iac. 45
think that is what ought to be done. For I don’t
see any chance of settling with Silius. My greet-
ings to Pilia and Attica.

The rest Ι have written myself. Pray see what
can be done. Publilia has written to me that her
mother is coming to me with Publilius at his sugges-
tion and that she will come too, if 1 will let her.

She begs me urgently and humbly to allow her and
to answer her. You see what a nuisance it is. Ι
