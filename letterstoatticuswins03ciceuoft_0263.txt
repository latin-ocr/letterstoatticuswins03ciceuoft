LETTERS To ATTICUS XIV. 13-13a

find something that suits me better, while Quintus
is not thinking of buying it at the present time.
He is quite bothered enough with repaying the
dowry,¹ and is expressing the deepest gratitude to
Egnatius for his assistance. To marrying again he
is so averse that he declares a bachelor’s couch is the
most comfortable in the world. But enough of this
also.

For now Ι return to the crushed or rather non-
existent republic. M. Antonius has written to me
about the recall of Sex. Clodius. You will see from
the copy I include that the tone of his letter, so fai·
as concerns myself‚ is complimentary enough. But
you can easily imagine the proposal is so unprincipled‚
so disgraceful, and so mischievous, that at times one
almost wishes for Caesar back again. For things that
Caesar never would have done, nor allowed to be
done, are now being brought forward from forged
notes of his. However, Ι have shown myself quite
complaisant to Antonius. For when 116 has once got
it into his head that he may do what he chooses, he
would have done it just as readily against my will.
So 1 have sent you a copy of my letter too.

ANToNY THE CONSUL SENDS HIS GRERTINGS TO Μ. CICERO.

It was only because I was so busy and you departed Rome, April
so suddenly, that 1 did not see you personally about 22 to 25,
the following request. So I fear Ι may have less 3.c. 44
weight with you in my absence. But if your good-
ness of heart answers to the opinion I have always
had of you, 1 shall be very glad.

¹ To Pomponia, sister of Atticus, whom he had recently
divorced.
