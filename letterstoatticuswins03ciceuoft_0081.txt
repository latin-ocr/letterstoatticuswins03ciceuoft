LETTERS TO ATTlcUS ΧΠ. 30-31

XXX

CICERO TO ATTlcus, GREETlNo.

Ι am trying to find something to say to you ; but Astura,
there is nothing. The same things every day. 1 am March 27,
much obliged to you for paying a visit to Lentulus. 13.c. 45
Assign him as many slaves as you like and select
them yourself. As to Silius' inclination to sell and
his price, you seem to fear first that he won't want
to sell and secondly not at that price. Sicca thought
differently3 but I agree with you. So, as he sug-
gested, 1 wrote to Egnatius. Silius wants you to
speak to Clodius. You have my full consent to do
so, indeed it is more convenient than for me to write
to Clodius myself‚ as he wanted. As to Castricius’
slaves I think it is most convenient that Egnatius
should carry the matter through,1 as you say you
think he will. With Ovia please see that some y
arrangement is made. As you say it was night
when you wrote, I expect more in to-day's letter.

XXXI

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlcus, GREETING.

Sicca is surprised that Silius has changed his Astura,
mind. For my part I am more surprised that, when March 29,
he makes his son the excuse—and it seems to me a n.c. 45
good enough excuse, as his son is all he could wish—
you say you think he will sell, if we add one other
thing, which he shrinks from mentioning, though
he has set his heart on it.2 You ask me to fix my
“ buy '⁹ 3 and Shuekburgh translates t-he end of the sentence

“if we should include something else, which he is anxious to
et rid of, as he had of his own accord determined not to

o so.”
