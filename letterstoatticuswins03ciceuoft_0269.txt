LETTERS TO ATTlCUS XIV. 13 b-14·

there is no enmity between our families. 1 fought
P. Clodius because I was fighting for the State, he
for his own hand ; and the State decided the merits
of our controversy. If he were alive now 1 should

than we have been as yet. For these feuds have

open to me than your house. But enough of this.

I have one thing to add, that, whatever 1 think
you wish, and whatever is to your interest, I shall
never have anv hesitation in carrying out with all
fmyl beart αιὲᾱξίεουΙ. Of that Ι hope you will feel

Ι am perfectly sure there were none but knaves.

-So please explain more in detail. As it happened,
when 1 had sent you a pretty long letter on the
26th, about three hours afterwards I received yours,
and a bulky one too. So there is no necessity for
me to tell you that I had a good laugh at your witty
