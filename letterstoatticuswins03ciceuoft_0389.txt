LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. ¹2

11

CICERO TO A'r'rlcus, Gnnn'rmo.

On the loth 1 received two letters, one by my Puteoli, July
own messenger, another from Brutus'. Here the 11, lac. 44
story about the Buthrotians was very different3 but
that, like many other things, we must put up with.
1 have sent Eros back sooner than Ι intended, that
there may be someone to pay Hortensius and Ovia,
with whom, indeed, he says he had made an ap-
pointment for the 15th. It is really shameless of
Hortensius, for there is nothing owing to him except
on the third instrument, which is due on the lst of
August 3 and the greater part of that instalment has
been paid some time before the proper date. But
Eros will see to that on the 15th.

In Publilius· case 1 don’t think there ought to be
any delay in letting him have a draft· for what is
owing. But, when you see how much I have yielded
my rights'in paying up half of a balance of .·Ε4,ΟΟΟ1
in ready money, and now giving a bill for the rest,
you may, if you think fit, tell him that he ought to
await my convenience, when 1 have waived so much
of my rights. But please‚ my dear Atticus—see how
coaxingly 1 put it-——do transact, regulate, and manage
all my affairs while you are in Rome, without waiting
for a hint from me. For though Ι have sufficient
outstanding debts to meet my creditors, it often
happens that the debtors don’t pay at the proper
time. If anything of that sort happens, consider
nothing so much as my credit. Preserve it not only
by raising a fresh loan, but by selling if necessary.

¹ 400 sestertia. 'Phe money was a repayment of the dowry
Cicero had received with his second wife, whom he had since

divorced.
