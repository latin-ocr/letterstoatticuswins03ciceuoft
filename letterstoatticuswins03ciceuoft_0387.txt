LETTERS TO ATT1CUS XVI. l

hope have we, then? ln Pansa, when he enters
office? There is nothing but midsummer madness
in their drunken dreams.

About the „829001 z well done 1 Put my son’s affairs
straight. For Ovius has just come, and brings much ‚
satisfactory news3 among other things, what is no
bad hearing, that 3700 ² is enough, quite enough, but
that Xeno treats him very sparingly and niggardly.
The excess over the rental of the town houses that
your. bill of exchange eost, may be reckoned to the
year, in which there was the additional expense of the
journey. From the lst of April on let him have up
to .·Εἰ800,3 for that is the rent of the city property
now. Some sort of provision must be made for him
when lie comes to Rome. F οι· I don’t think he could
endure that woman as a mother-in-law. 1 refused Pin-
darus' offer for the villa at Cumae. Now let me tell
you why Ι have sent a messenger. Young Quintus
is promising to be as prim as a puritan: and both
he and his father have begged me to go bail to you
for him, but on the condition that you only believe
it when you see it. 1 shall give him a letter accord-
ing to his fancy, but don't take any notice of it. Ι
am writing now to prevent you from thinking that
1 do. God grant he keeps his promise. It would
be a satisfaction to everybody. But I-—I woxi’t say
any more. He is leaving on the 9tl1. For he says
there is some money to be paid over on the l5tli,
but that he is very hard pressed You will judge
from my letter how to answer. More when l have
seen Brutus and am sending Eros back. I accept
dear Attica's apology and send her my best love.
Give my regards to her and Pilia.
