LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 5-—5a

V

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlcus, GREE'HNG.

“Quintus the elder for the fourth time ”¹ or Tusculum,

rather for the thousandth time is a fool to rejoice July, ac. 46
in his son’s new office2 and in Statius, that he may
see a double disgrace heaped on his house. Ι may
add Philotimus as a third disgrace. His folly would
be unparalleled, if my own had not been greater.
But what cheek of him to ask you for a contribution
towards it! Even suppose he had not come to a
“fount athirst,” but to a Pirene or “the hallowed
spot where Alpheus took breath,”³ to think of his
drawing on you as his fountain, to use your word,
especially when he is in such straits! Where will
such conduct end? But that is his own look out.

Myself I am delighted with my Cato: but then
Lucilius Bassus is delighted with his works too.

CICERO TO ATTlcus, GREETING.

About Caelius you must make enquiries, as you Tusculum,
say: I know nothing. But one must get to know May 31,
his character as well as his resources. If you have ac, 45
any doubts about Hortensius and Verginius, look
into the matter: though, so far as I can see, you are
not likely to find anything that will suit better.

Deal with Mustela as you say, when Crispus has
arrived. I have written to Avius to tell Piso all he

Luperci and the celebration of the Lupercalia on the Palatino

hill on February 15.
⁸ From Pindar, Nem. 1, 1, where it is used of the Arethusa

at Syracuse, which was po ularly believed to be connected
with the river Alpheus in t e Peloponneso. - ll
