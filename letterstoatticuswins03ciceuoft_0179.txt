LETTERS To ATTICUS XIII. 26-27

things are, there is certame no need to send it. But
let that be as you like. However, Ι will send you
a copy, perhaps from Lanuvium, unless Ι happen to
come to Rome. But you shall know to-morrow.

XXVII
cicano ‘ro A'r'ricus, Gann'rmo.

As for the letter to Caesar, Ι was always ready to Tusculum,
let your friends read it first. If I had not been, Ι Asty 25,
should not have done my duty by them, and should ac. 45
very nearly have imperilled myself, if Ι were likely
to offend him. But they have acted frankly‚ and I
am thankful to them for not concealing their feel-
ings; but the best thing of all is that they want
to make so many alterations that there is no sense
in my writing it all over again. However, what view
ought Ι to have taken of the Parthian war except
what I thought he wanted? Indeed what other
purpose had my letter save to kowtow to him? Do
you suppose I should have been at a loss for words,
if Ι had wanted to give him the advice which Ι
really thought best? So the whole letter is un—
necessary. For, when 1 cannot make a coup, and
a fiasco, however slight, would be unpleasant‚ why
should 1 run unnecessary risk? Especially as it
occurs to me that, as 1 have not written before, he
would think Ι should not have written until the
whole war were over. Besides I am afraid he may
think it is to sugar the pill of my Cato. ln fact I am
very sorry I wrote it, and nothing could suit my
wishes better than that they do disapprove of my
zeal. I should have fallen foul of ¹ Caesar’s party, and
among them your relative.
