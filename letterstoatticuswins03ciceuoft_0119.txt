LETTERS TO ATTICUS XlI. 50-51

L

elcmno ΤΟ A'r'rlcus, GREETlNG.

Your departure has depressed me as much as 'l'usculmm
your arrival cheered me. So, when you can, that May 18, ae.
is after you have attended Sextus’ auction, visit 45
me again. Even a single day will do me good,
not to speak of the pleasure. Ι would come to
Rome that we might be together, if Ι could make
up my mind satisfactorily on a certain point.

LI

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

1 have Tiro back with me earlier than I expected. Tusculum,
Nicias has come too and to-day I hear Valerius is May 20, ΒΛ).
coming. However many come, Ι shall be more 45
lonely than if you alone were here. But 1 expect
you, at any rate after you've finished with Peduc-
aeus ; and you give some hint of an even earlier
date. But let that be as you can.

For Vergilius, as you say. Ι should however like
to know when the auction is. Isee you think the
letter ought to be sent to Caesar. Well, Ι thought
so too very strongly, especially as there is nothing
in it that the most loyal of citizens might not have
written3 loyal, that is to say, in the present circum-
stances, to which all politicians tell us we should
bow. But you know Ι thought your Caesarian
friends ought to read it first: so you must see to
that. But, unless you feel sure they approve of it,
it must not be sent. You will know whether they
really think so or are pretending. I shall count
pretence as rejection. You must probe that point.
