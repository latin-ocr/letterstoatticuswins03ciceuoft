LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 7-8

that he wants for nothing: I had already mentioned
the point to you. It is a point that concerns my
duty and my reputation and dignity as well; and 1
see you take that view yourself. Of course, if Ι go
to Greece, as Ι should like, in July, everything will
be easier: but, as the times are such that Ι cannot
be sure what will be honourable, possible, or expe-
dient for me, I beg you to be careful that we supply
him with a reasonable and liberal income.

As usual you will consider these points and others
that concern me, and will write and tell me the
pertinent facts or, if there are none, whatever comes
into your head.

menno TO ATTIcus, GREETING.

When you wrote, you thought 1 was already in one Sinuessa,
of my seaside houses, and I have received your letter April 15,
on the l5th in my lodge at Sinuessa. Ι am glad about mc. 44
Marius, though I am sorry for the grandson of L.
Crassus.¹ It is a very good thing that Antony is
so approved of even by our friend Brutus. You
say Junia brought a letter written in a moderately
friendly tone : Paulus tells me it was sent to him by
his brother,² and that at the end of it there was a
statement that there was a plot against him, which
he had ascertained on excellent authority. Ι was
annoyed about that and he was still more annoyed.
I see nothing to object to in Cleopatra’s flight. l
should like you to tell me what Clodia has done.
You must look after the people of Byzantium like
everything else, and get Pelops ⁸ to call on you. Ι

⁸ Possibly the Pelops mentioned by Plutarch (Oic. 25), to

whom Cicero wrote about some honours the. Byzantines
proposed to confer on him. 229
