LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 32

CICERO TO ATTlcus, GREETING.

As 1 have received two letters from you to-day, Ι Tusculum,
did not think it right that you should content your· May 29,
self with only one of mine. Pray do as you say ιο] 45
about Faberius. For on that depends entirely what
I am thinking of. And, if that idea had never
occurred to me, believe me 1 should not bother
about that any more than anything else. So con-
tinue your energy—for you cannot add to it-and
push on and finish the matter.

Please send me Dicaearchus' two books About the
Soul and the Descent. Ι can't find the Mixed Constitu-

much like to have those three books now; they would
bear on what I am planning. Torquatus² is in Rome.

1 have sent orders for it to be given to you. Catulus
and Lucullus I believe you have already. Ι have
added new prefaces to the books, in which each of
them is mentioned with honour. Those composi-
tions I should like you to have, and there are some
others too. What Ι said about the ten legates,
you did not fully understand, Ι suppose because
Ι wrote it in sl1orthand.³ Ι was asking about C.
Tuditanus, who Hortensius told me was one of
them. I see in Libo that he was praetor in the
consulship of P. Popilius and P. Rupilius. Could
he have been legate fourteen years before he was
praetor, unless he was very late in getting the
quaestorship? Ι don’t think that was the case ; for
