. LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 20-21

frightened out of such talk by our friend Brutus'
frown? Young Quintus, you tell me, is Antony's
right hand man. So we shall easily get what we
want through him. Ῑ am wondering what sort
of speech Octavius made, if, as you thought, L.
Antonius introduced him to a public meeting.

Ι am writing in haste: for Cassius’ letter carriel-
is starting at once. 1 am going directly to call
on Pilia, and then on to dinner with Vestorius
by boat. My best love to Attica.

CICERO TO A‘r'rlcus.

Just after 1 had given Cassius* messenger a letter Puteola,
for you on the llth, came my messenger, and, May 11, mc.
to my extraordinary surprise, without a letter from 44
you. But Ι quickly conjectured you had been at
Lanuvium. Eros however had hastened to let me
have a letter from Dolabella, not about my debt
(for he had not got my letter yet), but an answer,
and a very good answer too, to the one of which
1 sent you a copy. No sooner had 1 got rid of
Cassius· messenger than Balbus came to see me.

Good God, how easy it is to see that he is afraid
of peace! And you know how secretive the man
is. Yet he told me Antony's plans. He is can-
vassing all the veterans, asking them to support
Caesar’s acts and to take an oath to that effect,
to keep in camps, which are to be inspected
every month by two officials. He grumbled too
, about the prejudice against himself, and every·
thing he said seemed to show affection for Antony.

In fact there is no reliability in him. To me
