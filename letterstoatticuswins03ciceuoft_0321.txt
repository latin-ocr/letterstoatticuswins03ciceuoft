LETTERS To AT'l'ICUS XV. 4

cler-:Ro To ATTJCUS, GREETING.

On the 24th, about four o'clock, came a messenger Arpinum,
from Q. Fufius bringing some sort of a note from him, May 24, ιι( ,
begging me to make it up with him. A very silly 44
letter as usual, unless one thinks that everything one
does not like is very silly. 1 sent an answer of which
1 think you would approve. The messenger delivered
two of your letters, one of the 22nd‚ the other of the
23rd. Ι answer the later and fuller one first. I ap-
prove.¹ Why, if even Carfulenus deserts him, it will
be the end of the world2 for him. Antony's plans,
as you describe them, are revolutionary. And 1 only
hope he will try to get his way through the people
and not through the Senate, which 1 think is probable.
But to me his whole policy seems to point to war,
since D, Brutus is being bbed of his province.
Whatever I may think of rutus’ resources, 1 don't
think that can happen without war. But Ι don’t
want war, since the Buthrotians are all right as it is.
You may smile : but 1 am sorry it was not rather ac-
complished by my persistence, diligenoe, and influ-
ence. You say you don't know what our friends are
to do: that difficulty has been bothering me for a
long time. So now 1 see it was folly to be consoled
by the Ides of March: for though our courage was
that of men, believe me we had no more sense than
children. We have only cut down the trec, not
rooted it up. So you see how it is shooting out,
