LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 25

Brutus was that I had gathered from your note that
he did not wish me to come to Rome now just to pay
my respects to him—but, as you say you have read
the letter, perhaps Ι was not quite clear. However,
as I am just on the point of coming, please see that
my presence on the l5th does not prevent his com-
ing to Tusculum at his convenience. For I shall not
want him at the auction—surely in such a business
you alone will be enough: but 1 do want him when
Ι make my will. That Ι would rather postpone for
another day now, so as not to seem to have come
to Rome expressly for that purpose. So Ι have
written to Brutus now that Ι shall not want him, as
Ι had thought, on the 15th. Ι should like you to
look aster all· this and see that we don’t inconvenience
Brutus in the least.

But what on earth is the-reason why you are so
frightened at my bidding you send the books to
Varro on your own responsibility? Even now, if you
have any doubts, let me know. Nothing could be
more finished than they are. 1 want Varro, especially
as he desires it: but, as you know, he is “a fearsome
man3 the blameless he would blame.” Ι often pic-
ture him to myself complaining of this perhaps,
that my side in the books is more fully defended
than his own, though 1 assure you, if ever you come
to Epirus, I will convince you it is not. For at pre-
sent l have to give way to Alexio's ¹ letters. How-
ever, 1 don’t despair of winning Varro’s approva13
and, as I have gone to the expense of a large paper
copy, I should like to stick to my plan. But Ι repeat
again, it must be on your responsibility. So, if you
have doubts, let us change to Brutus: he is also a

¹ Atticus’ steward.
