LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 19

that to the ten commissioners.1 That is certainly a
tough piece of business, but one has to put up with
it, and Ι am very thankful for it. As to the immi-
nence of war Ι never saw anything more obvious.
So let me flee, and in the way you suggest. I do
not know why Theophanes wants to see me, for he
wrote to me. Ι answered as best 1 could. But he
writes saying he wants to come to me to discuss his
own affairs and some that concern me. I am looking
for a letter from you. Pray see that nothing is done

Stgtius has written to me saying my nephew Quin-
tus has told him with emphasis that he cannot put
up with things, and has resolved to go over to Brutus
and Cassius. Here is something I am very eager to
understand: here is a puzzle I can't interpret. Per-
haps he is angry with Antony about something;
perhaps he is looking for some new way of dis-
tinguishing himself ; or perhaps it is all bunkum;
and no doubt that is what it is. But for all that Ι
am afraid, and his father is disturbed about him, for
he knows what he used to say about Antony; in-
deed, he said things to me which I cannot repeat.
What on earth he means I can't think. Ι shall only
have such commissions as I choose from Dolabella,
that is, none at all. Tell me if C. Antonius wanted
to be put on the land commission.2 He would cer-
tainly have been in his proper place. About Mene-
demus it is as you say. Please keep me posted up
in all news.

several of them wore nonentities.
