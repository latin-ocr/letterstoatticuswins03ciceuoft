LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 52-53

Make your mind easy about the Latin language.
You will say, “ What, when you write on such sub-
jects ? '¹ ¹ They are copies, and don't give me much
trouble. 1 only supply words, and of them Ι have
plenty.

CICERO TO ATT1cus‚ GREE'HNG

Though Ι have nothing to say to you, Ι write all Tuscubum,
the same, because I feel as though 1 were talking to May 22, ac.
you. Nicias and Valerius are here with me. I am 45
expecting a letter from you early to-day. Perhaps
there will be another in the asternoon, unless your
letter to Epirus hinders you: I don't want to inter-
rupt that. 1 have sent you letters for Marcianus
and for Montanus. Please put them in the same
packet, unless you have sent it off already.

² Atticus had oommented on the difficulty of rendering
Greek philosophie terms in Latin.
