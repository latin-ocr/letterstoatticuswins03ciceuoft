LETTERS TO A'l'TICUS XII. 13-14

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

1 am upset about Attica, though Ι agree with Astura,

Craterus. Brutus’ letter, though full of wise saws March 7,
and friendliness, drew from me many tears. This B.c. 45
solitude stirs my grief less than your crowded city.
You are the only person Ι miss3 but I find no more
difficulty about my literary work than if 1 were
λ at home. Still the old anguish oppresses me and
will not leave me, though 1 give you my word 1
do not give way to it, but fight against it.

As to what you say about Appuleius, Ι don’t

Δ think you need exert yourself, or trouble Balbus
and Oppius. He has promised them and told them
to let me know that he will not hother me at all.
But take care that my plea of ill-health is put in
every day. Laenas promised to certify. Add
C. Septimius, and L. Statilius. lndced anyone you
ask will pass his word for it. But if there is any
difficulty, Ι will come and swear myself to chronic
ill-health. Since 1 am going to miss the banquets)
I would rather seem to do so according to the rules
than on account of grief. Please dun Cocceius. tle
hasn't fulfilled his promise: and l am wanting to
buy a hiding-place and a refuge for my sorrow.

menno 'ro Amicus, onaa'rmo.

1 wrote to you yesterday about offering my ex· Astura,
cuses to Appuleius. I don’t think there will be March 8,
any bother. Any one you apply to is sure not to B.c. 45

² Apparently an augur had to bring evidence of ill-health

attested by three other augurs to escape attendance on
regular meetings and inaugural banquets. 27
