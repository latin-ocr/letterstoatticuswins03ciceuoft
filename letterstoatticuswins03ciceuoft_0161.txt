LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII 20-21

you suppose there was some aspiration which was
left unfulfilled? Of course one should not praise
one's own principles, but Ι cannot help praising my
past life, and yet Ι can well enough feel indifferent
about it, as indeed Ι (10. But that is enough and
more than enough about such a trifle.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlcus, Gnmn'rlNo.

l have senta very bulky letter to Hirtius, which 1 Astura,
wrote lately at Tusculum. This letter which you have July 29,
sent, I will answer later. Just now Ι prefer other n.c. 45
things. What can I do for Torquatus, unless l hear
from Dolabella? As soon as I hear, you shall know at
once. I am expecting messengers from him to-day ’
or to-morrow at the latest; and, as soon as they
come, they shall be sent on to you. Ι am expecting
to hear from Quintus. For when I was starting
from Tusculum on the 25th, as you know,I sent
messengers to him.

To return to business, the word inhibere suggested
by you, which at first took my fancy very much, Ι
strongly disapprove of now. For it is exclusively a
nautical word. That, however, 1 knew before3 but
1 thought rowers rested on their oars, when told to
inhibere. Yesterday‚ when a ship put in by my
house, 1 learned that was not so. They don’t rest
on their oars, they back water. That is very differ-
ent to the Greek ἔποχή. So change the word back
to what it was in the book¹; and tell Varro to do

¹ Academica 11. 94. Ἐποχή, of which the Latin rendering
is here discussed, is the technieal term in philosophy for
“ suspension of judgment.”
