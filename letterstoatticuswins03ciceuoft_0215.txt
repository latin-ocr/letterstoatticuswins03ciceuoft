LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 44-45

friendly with the Ligarii; but Ι see he was dead
before the trial. So please get Pharnaces, Antaeus
and Salvius to erase the name from all copies.

CICERO ΤΟ A‘r'rlcus, GREETING.

Lamia was with me after you lest, and brought Tusculum,
me a letter Caesar had sent to him. Though it Aug, 11,
was despatched earlier than those of Diochares‚ ac. 45
still it asserted plainly that he would come before
the Roman games.1 At the end he told him to
make all preparations for the games and not let
him hurry back for nothing. From this letter
there certainly seemed no doubt that he would
come before that date3 and Lamia said that Balbus
thought so too, when he read the letter.

1 see Ι have some additional days' holiday‚ but
please let me know how many. You can find out
from Baebius or your other neighbour Egnatius.

In exhorting me to spend the days in an expo-
sition of philosophy, you are only spurring a willing
horse; but note that 1 have to spend those days
with Dolabella. Now, if 1 had not been detained
on Torquatus’ business, there would have been time
enough to make an excursion to Puteoli and return
in time. Lamia has heard from Balbus, it appears,
that there is a good deal of ready money in the
house, which-ought to be divided as soon as pos-
sible, and a considerable amount of silver plate,
and that the auction of all but the real property
ought to take place at the earliest opportunity.
Please write and tell me what you think. Upon

² September 15-19. ¹99
