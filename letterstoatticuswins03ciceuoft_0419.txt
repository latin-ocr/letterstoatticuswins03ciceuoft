LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 8—9

him. Ι advised that he should make for Rome.
For it seems to me he ought to have the city
rabble, and, if he ucceeds in inspiring them with
confidence, even thffssssssfffftffiffi‘ffis-sffle. O Brutus,
where are you? What a golden opportunity you
are missing! 1 never fore5aw'33fflsj biit-lfflthought
something of the kind would happen. Now, Ι
want your advice. Shall I come to Rome, or stay
here, or flee tp Arpinum, which? would „be-*a* harbour
of refuge? Rome I think-fior sear I be missed,

if'ffe‘o'jsse th'nk a blow has been struck.) Read me
this riddle. Ι never was in a greater qufflfflw

CICERO TO A'r'rlcus, GREETING.

Two letters on one day from Octavian, now asking Puteoli,

me to come to Rome at once, as lie wishes to act Νου. 4, B.c.
through the Senate. Ι told him I did not think the 44
Senate could meet before January, and 1 really
believe that is so. But he adds “with your advice.”
In short lie is pressing, while 1 am temporizing. Ι
do not trust his age: Ι do not know his disposition.
I do not want to do anything without your friend
Pansa’s advice. I am afraid Antony may sueceed,
and I don't like going away from the sea, and Ι fear
some great deed may be done in my absence. Varro,
for his part, dislikes the boy’s plan3 I do not. If
he can trust his army, he can have Brutus, and he is
playing his game openly. He is dividing his men
R-into companies at Capua, and paying over their
'bounty money. Ι see war close upon us. Please
answer this letter. I am surprised my messenger
left Rome on the lst without a letter from you.
