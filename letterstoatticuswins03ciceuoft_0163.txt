LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 21-21a

on Lucilius: “ Pull up chariot and horses as a good

though not many. However, I shall be obliged if
you will keep back the others, so that Balbus may
not get unrevised copies and Brutus what is stale.

But enough of this; I don't want to seem to make
a fuss about trifles. Though these are now my
important things, for what else have 1?
