LETTERS To ATTICUS XII. 23-24

a very public place. They are cramped for room,
but more than sufficient for this purpose. Please
think of that. But don’t be afraid of the price
you mention for the gardenS. Ι don’t want plate or
raiment or any pleasant places now: I want this. Ι
see, too, who can help me. But speak to Silius;
you can't do better. 1 have given Sicca a com-
mission too. He answered that he has made an
appointment with him. So he will write and tell
me what he has done, and you will see to it.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETlNG.

1 am glad Silius has settled the business: for 1 did Astura,
not want to fail him and was afraid Ι might not be March 20,
able to manage it. Settle about Ovia as you say. ae. 45
As to my son it seems high time now ; but 1 want to
know whether he can get a drast for his allowance
changed at Athens or whether he must take it with
him; and as regards the whole matter please con-
sider how and when you think he ought to go.
Whether Publilius is going to Africa and when, you
can find out from Aledius. Please enquire and let
me know. And, to return to my own nonsense,
please inform me whether P. Crassus, the son of
Venuleia, died in the lifetime of his' father, P. Crassus
the ex-consul, as Ι seem to remember, or after his
death. Ι also want to know whether my recollection

Pay my respects to her and to Pilia.
