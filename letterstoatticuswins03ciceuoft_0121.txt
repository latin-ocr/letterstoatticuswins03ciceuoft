LETTERS TO ATTICUS ‘X11. 51-52

Tiro has told me what you think about Caerellia:
that it ill suits my dignity to be in debt, and that
Ι should give a note of hand,

“ Tha} you should sear the one and hold the other
sa e .

But of this, and much else, when we meet. However,
we must hold over the debt to Caerellia, if you
agree, till we know about Meton and Faberius.

menno TO A'l'rlcus, GREETING.

You know L. Tullius Montanus who has gone with Tusculum,
my son. Ι have received a letter from his sister’s May 21, ne.
husband saying that, through going bail for Flaminius, 45
Montanus owes Plancus nearly 4:200 ; 1 and that he
has made some request to you about it. Ι should
like you to assist him by speaking to Plancus or in any
other way you can. Ι feel under an obligation to
help him. If you know more about it than Ι do, or
if you think Plancus should be spoken to, Ι wish
you would write to me, that I may know how the
matter stands, and what I ought to ask him. I am
awaiting news as to what you have done about the
letter to Caesar. About Silius I am not much con-
cerned. You must get me either Scapula’s or
Clodia's gardens. But you seem to have some
doubts about Clodia. Is it about the date of her
arrival or as to whether the gardens are for sale?

But what is this that Ι hear about Spinther divorcing
his wife ?
