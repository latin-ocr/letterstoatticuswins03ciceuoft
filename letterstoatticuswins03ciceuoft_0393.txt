LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 2-3

may appear superfluous to them—to Oppius at any
rate, as 1 know he is a great admirer of yourS. But
just as you please.

As you say you are going to spend the winter in
Epirus, I shall take it kindly if you will come before
the time at which you advise me to return to Italy.
Send me letters as often as possible ; if on matters
of little importance, by any messenger you can find3
but if on important affairs, send some one of your own.

l will attempt a work in Heracleides’ style, if I
get safe to Brundisium. 1 am sending you my De
Gloria. Please keep it as usual, but have select
passages marked for Salvius to read when he has
an appropriate party to dinner. 1 am very pleased
with them, and l hope you will be too. Farewen,
and yet again farewell.

robbed of our constitution before we are robbed of
our private property. So you take more and more
delight in my treatise on Old Age daily. That in-
creases my energy in writing. You say you expect
Eros not to come to you empty-handed. I am glad
you have not been disappointed in the event; but at
the same time 1 am sending you the same composi-
tion more carefully revised, indeed the original copy,
with plenty of additions between the lines and cor-
rections. Have it copied ou large paper and read it
privately to your guests; but, if you love me, do it
