LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 1-2

the first thing that comes into my head—recently‚
wh'e'n' a't'Ses‘tius' request Ῑ paid' Caesar a visit and
was sitting waiting to be called in, he remarked:
“ Can 1 doubt that Iam heartily detested,when Cicero
sits waitin and cannot visit me at hisfflgenience ff
Yet, i ever there was a good-natured man, he is
one. However, I have no doubt that he dete's'ts me.’'
That and more to the same effect. But to return to
Usta-point. Write me anything there is to write, not
only imfflrtqQffla'gssers, but even petty details. 1
shall not set anything escape me. ““ ‘ ”

signs of the unanimous feeling of the people. The April 8,
applause given to Cassius Ι thought even overdone. Ec, 44
The other letter was about Bam-pate? though he is
not so bald as you think. For he has advanced,
though not very far. Ι have been detained too long
by his talk. What Ι mentioned to you, perhaps a
little obscurely, was like this. He said Caesar re-
marked to him, when 1 went to see him at Sestius’
request and was sitting waiting: “ Can I be foolish
enough to³think that this man, good-natured though
he is, is friendly to me, when he has to sit and wait
for my convenience so long.” So you have in Bald-
pate a bitter enemy of peace, that is to say, of
Brutus.

² Madaro = μαδαρῷ, “ bald-pate.” a pun on Calvena,
Matius‘ aynomen. The reading and rendering of the rest of
the sentence is doubtful.
