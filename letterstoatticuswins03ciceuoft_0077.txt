LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. ⁴28

please her; 1 have no interest in the matter, except
that you know of, which Ι consider important.

You call me back to my old way of life. Well,
1 have long been bewailing the loss of the Republic,
and that was what l was doing, though less strongly;
for Ι had one hai-bour of refuge. Now I positively
cannot follow my old way of life and employment3
nor do 1 think Ι ought to care what others think
about that. My own conscience is more to me than
’ all their talk. For the consolation 1 have sought in
writing, Ι am not discontented with my measure of
success. J t has made me show my grief less; but the
grief itself Ι could not lessen, nor would 1, if I could.

About Triarius you interpret my wishes well.
However do nothing without his family’s consent.
Ι love him, though he is dead: I am guardian to his
children, and feel affection for all his household. As
regards the business with Castricius, if he is willing to
take money estimated at its present rate instead oi
the slaves, nothing could be more convenient. But,
if things have gone so far that he is taking the
slaves away, Ι don’t think it is fair to him to ask him
(you ask me to give you my real opinion); for 1
don't want my brother Quintus to have any bother,
and 1 rather fancy you take the same view. If
Publilius is waiting for the equinox, as you say
Aledius tells you, I suppose he is going by sea; but
he told me he was going by way of Sicily. Ι should
like to know which it is and when. 1 should like
you too some time at your convenience to pay a visit
to little Lentulus1 and assign him such of the
household as you think fit. Love to Pilia and Attica.

¹ The son of Tullia and Dolabella, so called because Dola-
bella was adopted into the plebeian qens of the Lentuli -in
49 mo. in order to stand for the tribunate. 61
