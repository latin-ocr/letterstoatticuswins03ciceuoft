LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 39-40

expected something about Asinius Pollio’s letter.
But 1 am too apt to reckon your leisure by my own.
However I give you leave not to think yourself
bound to write, except in case of necessity, unless
you have plenty of leisure.

About the letter carriers Ι would do as you
suggest, if there were any pressing letters, as there
were lately. Then, however, the carriers kept up
to their time every day, though the days were
shorter, and we had something to write about, Silius,
Drusus, and other things. Now, if Otho had not
cropped up, there is nothing; and even that nothing
has been deferred. However it cheers me to talk
with you when we are not together, and still more
to read your letters. But, as you are not at home
(for 1 think you are not), and there is no necessity
to write, let there be a truce to writing, unless some
new point arises.

’ CICERO ΤΟ A'r'rlcus, onssm‘mo.

What sort of thing Caesar’s invective against my Astura,
panegyric will be, Ι have seen from the book, which May 9, ac.
Hirtius has sent me. He has collected in it all 45
Cato’s faults, but given me high praise. So I have
sent the book to Musca to pass on to your copyists;
for I want it to be published. To facilitate that,
please give your men orders.

1 try my hand often at an essay of advice. Ι
can’t find anything to say; and yet I have by me
Aristotle’s and Theopompus’ books to Alexander.

But what analogy is there? They could write
what was honourable to themselves and acceptable

to Alexander. Can you find anything of that sort ἑ
