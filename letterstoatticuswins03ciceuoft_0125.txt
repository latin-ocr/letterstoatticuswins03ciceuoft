CICERO'S LETTERS
TO ATTICUS
BOOK XIII

1

elcmw ΤΟ A'r'rxcus, GREETlNo.

You used just the right amount of severity and of Tusculum,
moderation in your letter to my son, and it was May 23,
exactly as Ι should have wished it to be. Your ac. 45
notes, too, to the Tullii¹ were full of good advice.

So either those letters will set things right or we
shall have to try some other means. As to the
money, I see you are making every effort, or rather
you have done so already. lf you manage it, 1 shall
owe the gardens to you. ’ Indeed, there is no other
kind of propertyI should prefer, especially for the
matter I have in hand. You remove my impatience
by your promise, or rather your pledge, about the
summer. There is nothing either that could be
found more likely to solace my declining years and
my sorrow. My eagerness for it impels me at
times to urge you to haste. But Ι restrain myself‚
for Ι have no doubt that, as you know I want it very
much, your eagerness more than equals mine. So

1 count the matter as already settled.
I am waiting to hear what your friends decide

about the letter to Caesar. Nicias is as devoted to
you, as he ought to be, and is highly delighted at
your remembering him. Ι am extremely fond of

² L. Tullius Montanus and M. Tullius Marcianus, who
were nt Athens with Cicero's son.
