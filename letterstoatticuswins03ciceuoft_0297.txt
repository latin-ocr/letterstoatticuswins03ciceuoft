LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 20

the 9th, from Lanuvium. So listen to my answer
to them all. First, my thanks for what you have
done in my affairs both in payment and in the
business with Albius. Then with regard to your
Buthrotum, when Ῑ was at Pompeii, Antony came
to Misenum: but he was gone again to Samnium,
before Ι heard he had come. See that you do
not build much hope on him. So Ι must see to
Buthrotum at Rome. L. Antonius’ speech is hor-
rible, Dolabella’s splendid. Let him keep his
money now, provided he pays on the Ides. 1 am
sorry about Tertulla’sl miscarriage. For we want
a crop of Cassii as much as one of Bruti. 1 hope
it is true about Cleopatra and about Caesar’s son 2
too. l have finished your first letter, now I come to
your second.

The Quinti and Buthrotum we will leave till Ι
come to Rome, as you say. Thanks for supplying
my son's needs. You think I am wrong in thinking
the republic hangs on Brutus: but it is a fact.
There will be none, or he and his party will save
it. You exhort me to send a written speech.
You may take it from me, my dear Atticus, as a
general axiom with regard to those matters, in
which Ι have sufficient experience, that no one,
whether poet or orator, ever thought anyone better
than himself. This is so even in the case of bad
ones: and what do you think it will be in the
case of Brutus, who has talent and learning?
Besides Ι have had experience of him lately over
the edict. I had written one at your request. I
liked mine, he liked his. Nay more, when Ι was in-
duced by his entreaties to dedicate to him my book

² A child of (cleopatra, called Caesarion. Caesar denied
the parentage.
