LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 43-44

eially when we have to bid against a man, who is
eager for the place, wealthy and one of his heirs.
What Ι should prefer aster that is Clodia's. But,
if nothing can be done about those, do anything.
Ι count myself more bound by sacred obligation
than anyone ever was by any vow. Look into
Trebonius’ place too, though the owners are away.
But, as 1 wrote yesterday, consider my Tusculan
place too, that the summer may not slip away.
Τ hat certainly must not happen.

CICERO To Ari-ricus, GREETING.

Ι am not at all annoyed that Hirtius wrote to you Astura, May
about me in a sympathetic tone (he was acting 13, ac. 45‘
kindly), and still less at your not sending his letter
to me, in which you were acting even more kindly.
The reason why I want your copyists to cireulate ·
the book he sent me about Cato, is that their abuse
may enhance Cato's reputation.

You say you are negotiating through Mustela.
He is a very suitable person and very devoted to
me since the affair of Pontianus. So get something
settled. But what is wanted except an opening
for a purchaser? And that could be got through
any of the heirs. But I think Mustela will manage
that, if you ask him. You will have provided me
not only with the very place Ι want for my purpose,
but a place to grow old in besides. For Silius' and
Drusus’ places don’t seem to me quite fit for a
paterfamilias. Why, I should have to spend whole
days in the country house. So 1 prefer the others,
Otho's first and then Clodia's. If nothing comes
of it, then we must play a trick on Drusus or fall

back on the place at Tusculum. 93
