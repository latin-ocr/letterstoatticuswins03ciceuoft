LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 29

(31οΕΠο ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREE'HNG.

You say you will see Silius to-day; so to-morrow, Astura,
or as soon as you can, write, if anything comes of March 25,
your meeting. Ι am not trying to avoid Brutus, 13.c. 45
though Ι don’t expect to get any consolation from
him. But there are reasons why I do not want to
go there at this particular time. If those reasons
continue to exist, Ι shall have to find some excuse
to offer him, and by the look of things at present, I
think they will continue.

As for the gardens, please finish the business.
The main point is what you know. A further con-
sideration is that I myself want something of the
kind; for I cannot exist in a crowd, nor can Ι be far
from you. For my purpose I cannot see anything
better adapted than that particular place, and I
should like to know what your opinion is. 1 am
quite sure, especially as I see you think so too, that
Oppius and Balbus are very fond of me. Let them
know how eager I am for the gardens and why ; but
that it is only possible, if the business with Faberius
is settled3 and ask whether they will go bail for the
payment. Even if I must bear some loss in return
for getting ready money, draw them on as far as they
will go: for there is no chance of getting the full
debt. In fact, find out if they show any inclination
to assist my plan. If they do, it is a great assist-
ance; if not, we must manage somehow or other.
Look upon it as “a place to grow old in,” to use
your own phrase, or if you like as a burial place for
me. It is no use thinking of the place at Ostium.
If we don't get this,I feel sure, we shall not get
Lamia'33 so we must try for Damasippus’ place.
