LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XII. 21

before the House, not in finding it out, nor in urging
them to take steps, nor yet in making up my own
mind before I took the House's opinion. And it
was because Cato extolled those actions of mine to
the skies and moved that they should be put on
record, that the vote was taken on his motion.
Brutus again seems to think he is giving me high
praise by calling me an “excellent consul.” Why,
has anyone, even a personal enemy, ever used a
more grudging term? To the rest of your criti-
cisms too what a poor answer he has given! He
only asks you to alter the point about the decree
of the Senate. He would have done as much as
that at the suggestion of a clerk. But that again
is his own look out.

Since you approve of the garden idea, manage
it somehow. You know my resourceS. If 1 get
something backl from Faberius, there will be no
difficulty. But Ι think Ι can manage even without
that. Drusus’ gardens are certainly for sale, and
Ι think those of Lamianus and Cassianus too. But,
when we meet.

About Terentia 1 cannot say anything more suit-
able than you do in your letter. Duty must be
my first consideration. lf 1 have made a mistake,
Ι would rather have to repent for her sake than
for my own. C. Lollius’ wife Ovia has to be paid
900 guineas.2 Eros says it can‘t be done without
me, 1 suppose because some property has to pass
between us at a valuation.³ 1 wish he had told you.
For, if, as he said, the matter is arranged, and that
is not precisely where he is deceiving me, it could be
managed through you. Please find out and finish it.
