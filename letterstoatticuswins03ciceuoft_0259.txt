CICERO ΤΟ A'r‘rlcus, GRRS'HNG.

The letter you sent on the 19th did not reaeh me Puteoli,
for seven days. In it you ask whether Ι take more April 26,
pleasure in hills and a view or a walk by the silver ac, 44
sea, and you seem to think 1 may not know myself.

Upon my word, both are so beautiful, as you say,
that I doubt which to prefer. “ But no thought have
we of the service of a dainty mea13 nay, seeing a
woeful heavy bane sent on us by heaven‚we shudder
in doubt whether we shall be saved οι· perish.'’
For although you have sent me great and welcome
news about D. Brutus having joined his troops, in
which 1 see great hopes, still, if there is going to be
civil war—and that there must be, if Sextus stays
under arms, as Ι know for certain he will—1 don't
know what we are to do. For now there will be
no chance of sitting on the fence, as there was in
Caesar's war. For, if this gang of ruffians thinks
anyone was rejoiced at the death of Caesar—and
we all of us showed our joy quite openly—they will
count him an ,enemy3 and that looks like a consider-
able massacre. Our alternative is to take refuge in
Sextus' camp, or join ourselves to Brutus if we can.
That is a hateful business and unsuitable for our age,
