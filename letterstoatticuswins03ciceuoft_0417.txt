LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 8

CICERO TO ATTICUS, onnm'lNG.

When 1 know what day I shall arx-ive, 1 will Puteoli,
let you know. I must wait for my heavy baggage‚ Nou-‚24 ge.
which is coming from Anagnia, and there is illness ff* ¹
in my household. On the evening of the lst Ῐ’ ’
got a letter f om Octavian. 'He is setting about
a heavy taskg He has brou t over the veterans,
who are at asilinum and Calatia, to his views3
and no wonder, when he is giving them 5201 ·· 30 >³¹
apiece. He thinks of visiting the other cochffiEs.
Obviously his idea is a war with Antony under his
leadership. So I see that before long we shall
be in arm . But whom are we to follow? Look
at his name, and at his age. And his first request
of me is that I should meet him secretly at Capua
or somewhere near Capua. Ihat is quite childish,
if he thinks it can be done secretly. Ι have told
him by letter that there is no necessity for it and
no possibility of it. :⁴He sent me one Caecina of
Volaterra, an intimate friend of his, who brought
ῒΙιίξ-ᾜῐιιςιῖξ, that Antony is making for Rome with
tlie legion Alauda, raisinff{'''‘forced contribution
from towns, ansmarsshifig'wiffiffis soldiers under

his side31they refused to take Antony's ounty,
or so he says, heaped influus on him and eft
him still haranguing. Of course, he offers himself
as our leader, and thinks we ought not to fail
