is rather surprised to find that he was still working
at his philosophical treatises, writing the De Officiis
to dedicate to his son,l and even eager to turn to
history at the suggestion of Atticus.2 Such is the
last glimpse we get of him in the Letters to Atticus.
Shortly afterwards he returned to Rome, and for
some six months led the senatorial party in its
opposition to Antony3 but, when Octavian too
turned against the party and the struggle became
hopeless, he retired to Tusculum, where he lived
until he was proscribed by the Triumvirs early in
December. Then he contemplated ssight to Greece,
but was killed at Astura before he had succeeded
in leaving Italy.

I must again acknowledge- my indebtedness in
preparing the translation to Tyrrell’s edition of the
Letters and to Shuckburgh’s translation, from both
of which I have “ conveyed” many a phrase. The
text is as usual based on the Teubner edition, and
textual notes have been mainly confined to passages
where a reading not found in that edition was
adopted. In those notes the following abbreviationes
are used :—

M = the Codex Mediceus 49, 18, written in the year
1389 A.n.‚ and now preserved in the Laurentian
Library at Florence. Ml denotes the reading of
the first hand, and M2 that of a reviser.

A=the reading of M when supported by that of
the Codeoe Urbinas 322, a MS. of the fifteenth
century, preserved in the Vatican Library.

O= Codex l, 5, 34 in the University Library at Turin,
written in the fifteenth century. Οι denotes the
reading of the first hand, and 02 that of a reviser.
