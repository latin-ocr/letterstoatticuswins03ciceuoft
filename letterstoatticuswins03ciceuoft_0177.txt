LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XIII. 25—26

follower of Antiochus. Ο that fickle Academy‚
always the same, now one thing, now another-‚¹ But
pray tell me, were you very pleased with my letter

keep coming back to the idea of my place at Tuscu-
lum. For anything is better than not getting it
finished this summer.

Under the present circumstances Ι am as comfort-
able at Astura as 1 could be anywhere. But as those

go? From Lanuvium Ι am trying to bring myself
to go to Tusculum. But I will let you know soon.
Please write the letters. You wouldn't believe how
much writing I get done by night as well as day,
for 1 cannot sleep. Yesterday I even composed a
letter to Caesar, as you desired. There was no harm
in writing it in case you thought it necessary: as
