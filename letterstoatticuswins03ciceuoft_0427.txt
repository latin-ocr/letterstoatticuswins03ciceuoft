LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 11

You make it as plain as daylight about Myrtilus.
How well you can always take that lot off! Is it
so? Do they accuse D. Βωιξιιεὲ1 A malison on
them! I have not hidden myself in Pompeii, as I
said Ι should3 first because of the weather, which
has been abominable, and seeondly because Ι get a
letter from Octavian every day, asking me to take
a hand in affairs, to come to Capua, to save the Re-
public. again, and anyhow to go to Rome at once.
It is a case of “ashamed to shirk, but yet afraid to
take.” He, however, has been acting, and still is
acting, with great vigour. He will come to Rome
with a big army3 but he is such a boy. He thinks
he can call a Senate at once. Who will come? 1f
anyone comes, who will offend Antony in this un-
certainty? Perhaps he may act as a safeguard on
the lst of January, or the battle may be over before
then. The country towns are wonderfully enthusi-
astic for the boy. For, as he was making his way to
Samnium, he came to Cales and stopped at Teanum.
There was a marvellous crowd to meet him and
cheers for him. Should you have thought it? That
will make me come to Rome sooner than 1 had
intended. As soon as I have arranged, I‚will
write.

Though I have not yet read the agreements—for
Eros has not come yet—still I wish you would get
the business settled on the l2th. It will make it
easier for me to send letters to Catina, Tauromenium,
and Syracuse, if Valerius the interpreter will let me
know the names of the influential people. For such
people vary with the times, and most of my par-
ticular friends are dead. However, 1 have written
general letters, if Valerius will content himself with

them ; otherwise he must send me names.
