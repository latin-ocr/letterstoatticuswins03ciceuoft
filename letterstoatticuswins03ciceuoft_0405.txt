LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 5-6

of inauguration is as happy as his name, and fits ex-
cellently with my plan for returning. Your letter
supplies a strong incentIve for going. 1 only wish

I am expecting a letter from Nepos. Does he

and he is one of the immortals. There is no collec-

some can be got from you. Those 1 ought to see
and correct, and then they may be published.

I could not have been more liberally entertained,
especially as he was away. So Ι got to Sicca on the
24th, and here I am quite at home. So Ι have stayed
a day longer than 1 meant. But 1 think, when Ι get to

they usually prevailed for eight days before the rising of the
Dggffirhedoe were ropes attached to the sail to set it to the
wind. Both would be let out to an equal length when
sailing before the wind. 389
