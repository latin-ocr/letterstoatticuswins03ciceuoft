LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 47-47a

Pollex the state of my exchequer. It would be a
disgrace to me that my son should run short of
money in his first year, whatever he may deserve.
Afterwards we will restrict him more ca1·.efully
Pollex also must be sent back, that Vestorius may
accept the inheritance. Clearly 1 ought not to
have gone to Puteoli, both on account of what
you say, and because Caesar is getting near.
Dolabella tells me he is coming to me on the 14th.
What a tiresome school-master l

CICERO TO ATTlcus,Gm·:E'r1NG.

Yesterday evening Ι had a letter from Lep idus Astura,
at Antium. That is where he is, for he hasp the Jul 30, 1³..c
house Ι sold. He implores me to be in the Senate ‚45
on the 1st, saying that both he and Caesar would
take it as a great favour. Ι don’t think it is of
any importance3 for Oppius would probably have
said something to you, as Balbus is ill. However
Ι would rather come for nothing, if necessary,
than have my absence noticed. I should regret
it afterwards. So to-day Ι go to Antium, to-
morrow home by midday. I should like you and
Pilia to come to dinner on the last of the mouth,
if you are not engaged.

Ι hope you have settled with Publilius. Ι shall
rush back to Tusculum on the lst; for Ι prefer
all the transactions with them to take place in
my absence. Ι am sending my brother's letter to
you: it is not a very kind answer to mine, but
I think it should satisfy you. You will see for your-
sclf.
