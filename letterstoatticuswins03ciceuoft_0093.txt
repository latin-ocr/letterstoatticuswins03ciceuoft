LETTERS To ATTICUS XII. 37-37a

Scapula's are the most public, and besides they are
near and one can be there without spending the
whole day in the country. So before you go away,
Ι should very much like you to see Otho, if he is in
town. lf it comes to nothing, 1 shall go to such
lengths as to rouse your wrath, accustomed though
you are to my folly. For Drusus certainly is willing
to sell. So, if there is nothing else, it will be my
fault if 1 don’t buy. Pray see that 1 don’t make
any mistake about it. The only way of making
sure against that is to get some of Scapula’s land, if
possible. Please let me know, too, how long you
are going to be in your suburban estate.

With Terentia her liking for you may help as
much as your influence. But do as you think fit.
For Ι know that you are generally more solicitous
about my interests than I am myself.

CICERO To A'r‘rlcus, GREETING.

Hirtius tells me Sextus Pompeius has quitted Astura,

Cordova and fied into Northern Spain, while Gnaeus May 5, ac.
·has fled, I know not whither, nor do I care. No 45
other news. His letter was posted from Narbo on

the 18th of April. You mentioned Caninius' ship-

wreck as though it was doubtful; so let me know,

if there is any certain information. You bid me

east off melancholy; very well, you will take a great

load off my mind, if you give me a site for the
shrine. Many points occur to me in favour of deifi-
cation; but I badly want a plac-e. So see Otho

too.
