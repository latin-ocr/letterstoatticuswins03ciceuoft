LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV 9—10

will be more. Two of them are the so-called consuls
designate. Good God, the tyranny lives though the
tyrant is dead! We rejoice at his assassination and
defend his actions. So see how severely M. Curtius
criticizes us! We feel ashamed to live, and 116 is
perfectly right. For to die is a thousand times
better than to suffer such things, which seem to
me to be likely to continue for some considerable
time.

Balbus, too, is here, and is often with me. He has
had a letter from Vetus, dated the last of De-
cember, saying that when Caecilius was besieged and
already within his grasp, the Parthian Pacorus came
with a large force, and so Caecilius was snatched
from his hands and he lost many men. For that he
blames Volcacius. So 1 suppose there is a war im-
minent there. But that is Dolabella's and Nicias’
look out. Balbus also has better news about Gaul.
Twenty-one days ago he had a letter that the Germans
and the tribes there, on hearing about Caesar, sent
ambassadors to Aurelius, who was appointed by Hir-
tius, saying that they would do as they were bidden.
In fact everything seems peaceable there, contrary
to what Calvena said.

should have to stay at Lanuvium, that Trebonius B.c. 44
must make his way to his province by roundabout
routes; that all the acts, notes, words, promises, and
projects of Caesar should have more validity than if

hc were alive? Do you remember that I cried aloud
