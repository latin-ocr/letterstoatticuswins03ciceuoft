LETTERS To ATT1CUS XVI. 6

Regium, there, being “ on a far voyage bent‚'' 1 shall
have to consider whether to procced by a merchant
vessel to Patrae or by packet-boats to Tarentine
Leucopetra, and thence to Corcyra3 and, if by a
merchant ship, whether direct from the Sicilian
strait or from Syracuse. On this point Ι will write
to you from Regium.

Upon my word, Atticus, Ι often say to myself:
“ Why, what avails thee all thy journey here?’' ¹
Why am not 1 with you? Why may I not see my
country houses, the jewels of Italy ? But that alone
is enough and more than enough, that Ι am not with
you. And what am I fleeing from? Danger? Nay,
unless Ι am mistaken, there is no danger now. For
it is precisely at the hour of danger that you bid me
come back. For you say my departure is praised to
the skies, provided 1 return by the end of the year;
and that I will certainly strive to do. For Ι had
rather be at home in fear and trembling, than in
your loved Athens without a sear. However, keep
your eye on the trend of events, and write to me, or
what Ι should much prefer, bring the news yourself.
Enough of this.

Please take my next requcst in good part. Ι know
you devote more care to it than Ι do myself. For
mercy's sake keep my accounts clear and pay my
debts. Ι have left a handsome balance3 but it re-
quires care to see to the payment of my fellow-heirs
for the Cluvian property on the lst of August. You
will see how to manage about Publilius. He ought
not to be messing, as Ι am not insisting upon my
legal rights. Still Ι should much like him also to be
satisfied. As to Terentia, what am Ι to say ? Pay her
even before the proper date, if you can. But if, as
Ι hope, you are coming soon to Epirus, pray make
