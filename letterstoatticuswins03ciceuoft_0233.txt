CICERO TO AT'mcus, GREETING.

I have sto ed „for a gisit with the man we were At Matius’
s ing of in the morning.¹ His view is that nothing villa, Apgil
could be rnore dis aceful antTTfie-thing was quite 7, ac, 44 „
hopeless. ’ῑῐῖὁῆἶῗῖᾙῖἔὲῑ with his genius could not “‘s‘
find a solution, who will find it now?’' In a word
lie-{aid the end had come (which may be true, but
he was pleased about it), and assured me that in less
than twenty days there would be a rising in Gaul7·1
He has not discussed the matter with anyone except
Lepfflfiffifffizeffiemss of March: and, in fine, things
cannot pas} 91? like this. What a wssE‘fissffss oppius!
He regrets Caesar quite as much, but says nothing
that Efflffend any‘BT‘ffie‘ loyal party. So much
for that. *Q* ⁷

Pray do not delay in sending me any news—and Ι
expect there is plenty: among other things whether
we may be sure of Sextus, but especially about our
friend Brutus. About him the man 1 am staying
with says Caesar used to say: “ What he wants is of
great importanee, but whatever he wants, he wants
it adly ”3 and that he noticed it, when he pleaded
for eiotarus at Nicaea, for he seemed to speak with
ernpfiaffss‘afid with boldness. l Again—-I like to write

s yffi-.
