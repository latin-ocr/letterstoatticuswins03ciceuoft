LETTERS To ATTICUS Xlll. 20

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlcus, GREm'rlNG.

1 have received a letter of consolation from Arpinum,

Caesar, posted on the last of April at Hispalis. Ι July 2 or 3,

the city are3 and 1 should much like to know. Ι
am not displeased that Torquatus is satisfied with my
attentions, and I shall not cease to increase them.

eome as arranged. 1 think you have met my
brother; so I am anxious to know what happened.

About my reputation Ι don’t care a straw ;

was nothing better; for it is not worth bothering
about. And see what deep philosophy there' is in
this other sentiment of mine, “ In all one’s life one
ought not to stray a nail’s breadth from the straight
path of conscience.'' Do you think 1 am engaged
in philosophical treatises for nothing? l should be
sorry for you to distress yourself about a mere
nothing. Now I come back to my point. Do you
suppose I care sor anything in the whole matter, ex-
cept that I should not be untrue to it.2 I am striving,
it seems then, to maintain my position in the law

courts. God forbid! Would I could bear my
private sorrow as easily as I despise them. But do
