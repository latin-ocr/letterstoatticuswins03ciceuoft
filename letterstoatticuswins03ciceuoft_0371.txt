LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XV. 22-23

elei-:Ro To ATTICUS, GREE'HNG.

Young Quintus’ absence is a blessing; he won’t be Tusculana,
a nuisance to us. 1 believe Pansa is talking amiably. June 27, ac,
1 know he is always hand in glove with Hirtius; 144
think he will be quite friendly with Brutus and
Cassius, if it is expedient—but will he ever see them ?
—and that he will oppose Antony: but when and
how? How long are we to be fooled ? Ι said Sextus
was coming, not because he was already near, but
because he certainly has it in mind, and does not
show the least sign of laying down his arms. Cer-
tainly, if he goes on, war must come. But our good
lover of Cytherisl thinks no one sure of his life
unless he gains a victory. What has Pansa to say
to this? And which side will he take if there is
war? So far as Ι can see, there will be. But more
of this and other things when we meet—to-day‚
according to your letter, or to-morrow.

CICERO ΤΟ A'r'rxcus, GREE'HNG.

I am absolutely on the rack, but not with pain. Tusculum,
So many ideas for and against that journey of mine June 24 or
keep occurring to me. You will ask how 1011325,n.c. 44
that is going to last. Until the matter is settled,
and that won’t be till I am on board ship. If Pansa
sends an answer to your note, I will forward my
letter and his. I am expecting Silius, and have a
memorandum drawn up for him. If there is any
news Ihave written to Brutus. If you know
anything about his movements, I should be glad to
hear that too.
