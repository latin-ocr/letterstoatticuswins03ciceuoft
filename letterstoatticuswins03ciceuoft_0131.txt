LETTERS To ATTICUS XIII. 3-4·

like to increase their number.l Ι agree with you in
both points. So we must make the best of them as
they are. Sometime you would have had to go bail
for me even in this sale.² So now Ι shall pay in full
myself. As to the delay in collecting the money, if
only I get what I want, I think Ι can arrange for
delay with the auctioneer or at any rate with the
heirs.

See about Crispus and Mustela, and Ι should
like to know what the share of the two is. I had
heard already of Brutus’ arrival, for my freedman
Aegypta had brought me a letter from him. 1 have
sent it to you, as it is obligingly written.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

l have received your piece os work about the ten Tusculum,
ambassadors: and I agree with you about Tuditanus. June 1,
For the son was quaestor in the year after Mummius B.C. 45
was consul.⁸ But, as you keep on asking if I am
satisfied about the debtors, I too keep on answering
that 1 am. Arrange something with Piso if you can :
for I think Avius will do his duty. I wish you could
come first3 but, if you can't, at any rate be with me,
when Brutus ¹comes here. It is of great importance
to me that we should be together. You will be able
to ascertain the day, if you commission a servant to
find out.

¹ Apparently Faberius had offered to make over a number
of debts due to him in payment of his debt to (licem, wit-h
an alternative of a large debt from Caelius or smaller ones
from several other debtors.

² ἑο. even in the purchase of the gardens for Tullia’s
shrine, of which Atticus disapproved. But the reading may
be corrupt. ³ 145 B.o.
