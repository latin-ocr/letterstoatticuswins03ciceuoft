LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 523

would have been fairer, as he is on the point of a
sudden long Journey, and upon my soul I should
have much preferred that we should meet in Rome
rather than in my house at Tusculum, now that the
state of our feelings prevents us from living together
at all, for of course you understand what constitutes
good company.

There is no delay about the books dedicated to
Varro. They are finished‚ as you have seen; there
is only the correction of the copyists’ mistakes.
About those books you know 1 have had some
hesitation, but you must look to it. The copyists
have in hand, too, those I am dedicating to Brutus.

Carry out my instructions as you say. However
what about that abatement ?1 Trebatius says every-
body is taking advantage of it. What do you
suppose my debtors will do? You know the gang.²
So settle the matter accommodatingly. You would
never believe how little Ι care about such things. I
give you my solemn word for it, and Ι hope you will
believe me, that the little I have causes me more
annoyance than pleasure. For I am more grieved
at having no one to leave it to than pleased at having
enough for my own enjoyment. Trebatius tells me
he told you so; but perhaps you seared I should be
sorry at the news. That was certainly kind of you3
but, believe me, I don't care about such things now.
So get you to your conferences, hack away at it and
finish the business3 and in talking with Polla con-
sider you are talking with that fellow Scaeva‚⁸ and

⁸ Caesar had a favourite centurion named Scaeva, and that
may be the person here referred to. If so it means ‘⁴ remem-
ber they are all people who have shared Caesar’s plunder.'’
But many regard the name and the words da to confice as a
quotation from some play.
