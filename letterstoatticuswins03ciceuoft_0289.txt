LETTERS TO ATTICUS X1V. 17a-18

that you should not only protect but honour the
men who paved the way for freedom. But 1
hope we shall soon meet to discuss these things.
Do you, my dear Dolabella, take the greatest
care of yourself. since you preserve the state and
all of us.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlcus.

You are continually reproaching me now with Pompeia,
lauding Dolabella to the skies more than I ought. May 9, mc.
But, though l strongly approve of his action, still 44
it was one and then another letter of yours which
induced me to belaud it so highly. But Dolabella
has entirely lost your good graces for the same
reason that he has made me too a bitter enemy.
What a shameless fellowl He has not paid yet,
though lie ought to have done sol on the first of
January, especially as he has freed himself from
enon-mous debts by the handwriting of Faberius
and has sought help from the goddess of help.1
For 1 must have my joke, that you may not think
1 am seriously concerned. I had written too to
him very early on the Sth, and on the same day
in the evening 1 got a letter from you at Pompeii,
delivered very quickly on the third day after
you wrote it. But, as Ι told you then, my letter
to Dolabella was sufficiently stinging. lf it takes
no effect, 1 don’t think he will be able to face me.

I think you have settled Albius’ business. With

Cicero ag ainsi Antony, that he used for his own purposes the
gaft-528 esum left by Caesar‘ m the public treasury in the temple
