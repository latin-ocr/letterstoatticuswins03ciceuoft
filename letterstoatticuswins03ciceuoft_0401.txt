LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XVI. 4-5

to Sestus, Bucilianus, and others. For l don't count
on cassius’ fleet, which is quite a fine one, beyond
the straits of Sicily. There is one point that annoys
me a little, Brutus seems in no huri-y. First he is
waiting for news of the completion of his games;
then, so far as I can understand, he is going to sail
slowly, stopping at several places. Still Ι think it
will be better to sail slowly than not to sail at all;
and if, when we have got some distance, things seem
clearer, we shall take advantage of the Etesian
winds.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlcus, GREETING.

Brutus is expecting a letter from you. The news Puteoli,
Ι brought him about Accius’ Tereus was no news. July 9, n.c.
He thought it was the Brutus} There had, however, 44
been some breath of rumour that at the opening of
the Greek games the audience was small, at which,
indeed, Ι was not at all surprised; for you know
what Ι think of Greek games.

Now hear the most important point of all. Quintus
has been with me several days, and, if I had desired‚
he would have stayed longer; but, so far as his visit
went, you would not believe how pleased l was with
him in every way, and especially in that in which l
used most to disapprove of him. For he is so totally
changed, partly by some works of mine, which I
have in hand, and partly by my continual advice
and exhortation, that he will in the future be as
loyal as we could wish to the constitution. After
he had not only asseverated this, but convinced me

² Cf. Act. xvl. 2. Not being present Brutus had supposed
it wan the play called Brutus, whereas it wan the Tereus.
