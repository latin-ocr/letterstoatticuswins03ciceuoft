remember to plead my excuses for my slowness in
writing, as I told you. What your friend Mundus
has *done with M. Ennius about the will, please

clcssno ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ι am glad you recommend me to do what Ι did of my Arpinum,
own accord yesterday. For to the same messenger, July 3, ac,
to whom Ι gave the letter I sent you on the 2nd, I 44 -
also gave another for Sestius, written in very friendly
terms. It is very good of him to follow me to Puteoli,
but he has no grounds for his complaint. For it was
not my business to wait for his return from Cosa, so
much as it was his not to go until he had seen me,
or to return more quickly. He knew Ι wanted to
start in a hurry, and he told me he would come to
me at Tusculum. I am grieved that you wept when
you left me. If you had done so in my presence, I
might have changed all my plans about going. But
there is one good thing, that you were consoled by
the thought of meeting me again soon; and that,
indeed, is the hope that buoys me up. I will not
stint you of letters, and will give you full news
about Brutus. Ι will send you my book On Glory
soon. Ι will hammer out something in the style of
Heracleides to be stored up in your treasure-house.

I remember about Plancus. Attica has good reason
for grumbling. Ι am much obliged to you for telling
me about the garlands for Bacchus and the statues,
Please don't omit any detail of the same importance,

or even of the smallest importance in the future. 6Ι
