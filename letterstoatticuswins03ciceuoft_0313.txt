LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. la

Ia
CICERO 'ro Ar'ricus, cunm-mo.

Yesterday l sent offa letter to you as 1 was leaving Sinuessa,
Puteoli and stopped at my house at Cumae. There May 18, ac.
1 found Pilia enjoying the best of health. Indeed, 44
l saw her again shortly afterwards at Cumae. For
she had come for a funeral, which 1 also was attend-
ing. Our friend Cn. Lucullus was burying his mother.
So 1 stayed that day at Sinuessa, and there 1 have
seribbled this as 1 am starting early in the morning
of the next day for Arpinum. However, Ι have no
news either to write to you or to ask from you, unless
you think this is to the point. Brutus has sent
me the speech he delivered in the meeting on the
Capitol, and has asked me to correct it without re-
garding his feelings, before he publishes it. Now the
speech is most elegantly expressed as regards its
sentiments, and its language could not be surpassed.
But myself, if Ι had pleaded that cause, 1 should
have written with more fire. You realize what the
theme is and what the speaker is. So 1 could not
alter it. For considering the style our friend Brutus
affects and the opinion he holds of the best style of
oratory, he has attained it in its highest elegance in
this speech. But rightly or wrongly 1 have aimed
at something different. However, l should like you
to read the speech, if you have not done so already,
and to let me know your opinion, though Ι am afraid
that your name will lead you astray and you will be
hyper-Attio in your criticism. However, if you will
recall Demosthenes· thunder-bursts, you will be able
to realize that one can use considerable force even in
