LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 20

“ on the best oratorical style,’' he wrote not only to
me but to you also, that what Ι found pleasing, he
did not approve. So, pray, let every man do his
writing for himself. “To each his own wife; mine
for me. To each his own love; mine for me.'’
It is not neatly put, for it is by Atilius, the most

Pompeii: and he quite convinced me that he was
well inclined and desirous of peace. 1 can see quite

edict of Brutus and Cassius Ι approve. You want
me to consider what Ι think they ought to do.
One has to form one’s plans according to circum-

of his against Antony have both done a lot of
good. Things are certainly advancing: and now
we seem to be going to have a leader, which is
the very thing the country towns and the well
affected want. You mention Epicurus and dare
to say “take no part in politics.'' Are you not
