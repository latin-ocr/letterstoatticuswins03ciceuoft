LETTERS To ATTICUS XVI. isa-131>

was not yet light enough. But, when it got light,
I began to read the first of your two letters, having
already written one to you. Your note was a model

be more mal ὰ propos than such an answer to a
letter in which I had asked for your advice. Then
there is your other letter, in which you advise

was bad. This letter I am sending the next
morning as I am leaving.
