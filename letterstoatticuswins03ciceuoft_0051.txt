LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 18

C¹CERO TO ATTlcus, GREETING.

In trying to escape from the painsul sting of Astura,

recollection 1 take refuge in recalling something to Illarclz 11,
your memory. Whatever you think of it, please ae. 45
pardon me. The fact is I find that some of the
authors over whom 1 am poring now, consider
{figg’ffiz ζῖΐυῖἓῖἆ {¹¹3¹}AE h53u¹2¹13213v3f32¹¹st9¹³i
mean the shrine. Please give it all the attention
your affection for me dictates. For my part Ι have
no doubt about the design (I like Cluatius’ design)‚
nor about the erection (on that I am quite deter-
mined); but I have some doubts about the place.
So please consider it. 1 shall use all the oppor-
tunities of this enlightened age to consecrate her
memory by every kind of memorial borrowed from
the genius of all the masters, Greek and Latin.
Perhaps it will only gall my wound: but 1 consider
myself pledged by a kind of vow or promise3 and
1 am more concerned about the long ages, when
1 shall not be here, than about my short day, which,
short though it is, seems all too long to me. I have
tried everything and find nothing that gives me
rest. For, while 1 was engaged on the essay l
mentioned before, l was to some extent fostering
my grief. Now I reject everything and find nothing
more tolerable than solitude. Philippus has not
disturbed it as I feared: for after paying me a
visit yesterday he returned at once to Rome.

1 have sent you the letter I have written at your
suggestion to Brutus. Please have it delivered with
your own. However I have sent you a copy of it,
