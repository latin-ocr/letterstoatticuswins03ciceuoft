LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 162

that he did not want to offend the people, while they
were in Rome—for, as you know, he aimed at popu-
larity—but when they were across the sea, he would
see to it that they were transferred to some other
land. That was what happened in Caesar’s lifetime.
But, after Caesar’s death, as soon as the consuls in
accordance with a decree of the senate began to in-
vestigate cases, the facts as 1 have stated them were
put before them. They approved of the case without
any hesitation, and said they would send you letters.
Now, my dear Plancus, though Ι have no doubt that
a decree of the Senate, a statute, a decree of the
consuls, and their despatch, will have the greatest
weight with you, and 1 understand that you will
wish to please Atticus himself, yet Ι have taken it
upon myself in view of our connection and affection,
to ask you for what your own exceptional amiability
and your goodness of heart would win from you
themselves. That is, that you should for my sake
do this thing, which I am sure you will do os
your own accord, freely, fully, and quickly. l have
no greater and no dearer friend than Atticus. At
first it was only a question of his money, and a good
sum of it too; but now it concerns his credit too,
that he should obtain with your assistance what he
won by his great persistency and his popularity both
in Caesar’s lifetime and after his death. If he ob-
tains it from you, l hope you will consider that 1
shall interpret your liberality as a great favour be-
stowed upon myself. For my part, l will show
care and dilig-enee in anything that 1 think you
desire or that concerns you. Take care of your
health.
