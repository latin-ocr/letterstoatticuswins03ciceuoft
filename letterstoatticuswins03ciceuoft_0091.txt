LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 36-37

the plan, please read the law and send it to me. If
any means of avoiding it occurs to you, we will
ado t it.

Itpyou should be writing to Brutus and don't think
it out of place, reproach him for refusing to stay in
my house at Cumae for the reason he gave you. For
when Ι come to think of it, I don’t think he
could have done anything ruder. If you think we
ought to go on with our idea about the shrine, I
should like you to speak to Cluatius and spur him
on. For, even if we decide on another place, I
think we must make use of his labour and advice.
Perhaps you may be going to your country house
to-morrow.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

Yesterday I received two letters from you, one Astura,
given the day before to Hilarus, the other on the May 4, ac
same day to a letter-carrier; and on the same day I 45
heard from my freedman Aegypta that Pilia and
Attica are quite well. Thanks for sending Brutus'
letter. He sent one to me too, which only reached
me on the thirteenth day. Ι am forwarding the
letter itself and a copy of my answer.

About the shrine, if you don't get me any gardens
——andyou ought, if you love me as much as Ι know
you do—I approve highly of your scheme about the
place at Tusculum. In spite of your acute powers
of thought so bright an idea would never have come
into your head, unless you had been very anxious
for me to secure what I was very much bent on
having. But somehow or other Ι want a public
place; so you must contrive to get me some gardens.
