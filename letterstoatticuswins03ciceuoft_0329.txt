LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 5-6

L. Antonius is attacking Ι). Brutus, and the others
attacking our friends, what am 1 to do and how am 1
to bear myself ? As things are now Ι have made up
my mind to keep away from a city in which 1 have
not only been distinguished in the highest position,
but have even maintained some position in servitude.
Ι have not quite made up my mind to leave Italy,
a question which Ι will discuss with you, so much as
not to, go to Rome.

is a little annoyed with Antony, he is very much
devoted to the cause); in spite of my doubts 1 wrote
to him and commended to his care the maintenance
of Brutus’ and Cassius’ position. What his answer
was 1 want you to know, to see whether you think
the same as Ι do, that the Caesarians are even now
afraid our friends have more courage than they really

for Tusculum. Don’t think I shall do anything so
energetic as to hurry back for the 5th. Ι see no need
for my protecting anyone, since proper precautions
