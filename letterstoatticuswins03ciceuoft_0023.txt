LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 2-3

will come straight from the road to me. For we
will arrange a day for Tyrannio at the same time,¹
and anything else there is to do.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

You are the only person Ι know less given to Tusculum,
flattery than myself, and, if we both fall into it June 11,
sometimes in the case of other people, certainly we ac. 46
never use it to one another. So listen to what Ι
am saying with all sincerity. On my life, Atticus,

l don't count even the Isles of the Blest, let alone
my place at Tusculum-though in other respects
I’m comfortable enough there—worth so long a
separation from you. So let us harden our hearts
for these three days—assuming that you are affected
as I am, which 1 am sure is the case. But I should
like to know whether you are starting to-day ² imme—
diately after the auction‚ and on what day you are
coming. In the meantime Ι am buried in my books,
and annoyed that I have not got Vennonius’ history.
But, not to neglect business altogether, for that debt
that Caesar assigned to me ³ there are three means Ι
might use. I could buy the property at a public
auction ; but Ι would rather lose it—it eomes to the
same thing in the end, besides the disgrace. 1
might transfer my rights for a bond payable a year
hence by the buyer: but whom can Ι trust, and
when would that “year of Meton’' 4 corne? Or 1

⁴ Meton, an Athenian mathematioian, of the beginning of
the 5th century 13.o.‚ discovered the solar eycle of 19 years.
“Meton's year'’ was proverbially used for an indefinitely
long period.
