LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 46-47

commission him to accept at my orders. So this
same Pollex can take the message. 1 discussed
Cluvius’ gardens with Balbus too, and he was most
obliging. For he said he would write to Caesar
at once, but that Cluvius had subtracted from
Hordeonius’ legacy some ,4:5001 for Terentia, the
cost of his tomb and a lot of other things, but
nothing from my share. Ple-ase remonstrate with
Vestorius. It is surely most out of place for Plotius
the persumer to send his own special messengers
with full particulars to Balbus so long in advance,
while Vestorius does not send me news even by
my messengers. Ι am sorry about Cossinius; I was
fond of him. -

Ι will make over to Quintus anything that may
be left after paying my debts and making pur-
chases, for which Ι am afraid Ι shall incur more debt.
About the house at Arpinum I know nothing.

There is no necessity to grumble at Vestorius,
for to-night‚ after I had sealed this letter, my
messenger came bringing a letter full of details
and a copy of the will.

CICERO TO ATTiCUS, GREETING.

“When from thee, Agamemnon, the message Tusculum,
reached my ears,'' not “that Ι should come '’ Aug, 13,
(though I should have done that too, if it had nc, 45
not been for Torquatus), “straightway'' I gave
up what I had begun, threw down what Ι had
in hand and made a rough sketch of what you
ordered.² I should like you to find out from

² ie. he gave up working at, the De Natura Deorum, and
set about writing a letter to Caesar.
