LETTERS TO A'I'TICUS XIII. 49

case. It went against the grain with me to take
it at all against the sons of Cn. Octavius; but
for Phamea’s sake Ι agreed.l For, if you remember,
when I was standing for the consulship, he sent a
promise of any assistance he could render through
you; and Ι appreciated it as much as if Ι had
used it. He came to me and said the judge had
undertaken to hear his case on the very same
day that the jury were bound by the Pompeian
law to settle that of our friend Sestius. For you
know the days of those cases have been fixed by
law. 1 answered that he could not but be aware
of my obligations to Sestius. If he would choose
any other day, Ι would not fail him. So then he
left me in a temper. I think I told you about
it. I did not bother · myself about it of course,
not thinking that a perfectly unwarrantable fit of
anger of a stranger concerned me. However Ι told
Gallus the next time I was in town what I had
heard, without mentioning young Balbus. Gallus

, took the matter up, as he tells me. He says

Tigellius asserts that I suspect him because of my
bad conscience about my desertion of Phamea.
Accordingly Ι commission you to find out what
you can from young Balbus, but not to bother
your head about me. It is quite a good thing to
have somebody to hate with a will, and not to
pander to everybody any more than to be asleep
for everybody.2 Though upon my word, as you
know, Caesar’s party are obsequious to me more
than I to them, if attention is obsequiousness.

that Cipius used to shut his eyes to his wife's barefaced
amours in his presenee; but when a servant, thinking him
asleep, stole a cup before his eyes, he woke up with this

remark.
