LETTERS To ATT1CUS XIII. 50

L

CICERO TO AT'I'ICUS, GREETlNG.

You suggested in one of your letters that Ι Tusculum,
should set about composing a longer letter to send circa Aug.
to Caesar, and Balbus told me lately at Lanuvium 24, 8.C. 45
that he and Oppius had written to Caesar telling
him Ι had read his books against Cato and strongly
approved of them: so I wrote a letter to Caesar
about those books to be sent to Dolabella. But
I sent a copy to Oppius and Balbus, asking them
to send on my letter to Dolabella, if they them-
selves approved of the copy. So they have answered
that they never read anything better and have had
my letter forwarded to Dolabella.

Vestorius has written asking me to make over
my share in the property of Brinnius to a >slave
of his on behalf of one Hetereius, so that he can
complete the transfer at Puteoli according to law.
1f you think it right, send the slave to me; for
1 suppose Vestorius has written to you too.

About Caesar’s coming Oppius and Balbus tell
me the same as you. I am surprised that you have
not yet had a talk with Tigellius. For instance,
I should much like to know just how much he got3
however I don’t really care a straw. You ask what
I think about going to meet Caesar. Where are
you thinking of, unless it is Alsium? Indeed Ι
have written to Murena asking him to take me
in; but I suppose he has gone with Matius. So
I shall inflict myself on Sallustius.

When I had written the last line, Eros told me
Murena gave him the kindest of answers: so let me
make use of him. For Silius has no cushions, while

Dida, I believe, has given up his whole villa to guessstsl.
