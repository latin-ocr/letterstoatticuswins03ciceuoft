LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 18-19

regard to Patulcius’ debt, it was most kind of you
and just like yourself to come to my aid. But
1 seem to have deserted Eros, who is just the
man to clear the matter up: it was through a
grave fault of his that it went wrong. But 1 will see
to that with him.

Montanus’ business, as 1 have often said, you
must take charge of entirely. Ι am not surprised
that Servius spoke to you in a tone of despair,
when he was leaving; and my despair quite equals
his. What our friend Brutus is going to do in
the Forum, incomparable hero though he is, if he
is not going to attend the Senate on the first of
June‚,1 do not know. But he should know this
better himself. From the things Ι see in course
of preparation Ι don't think the Ides of March
are going to help much. So Ι am daily thinking
more and more of Greece. For I fail to see what
use Ι can be to Brutus, who, as he writes to
me, is meditating exile. Leonidas’ letter did not
give me much pleasure. Ι agree about Herodes. Ι
should like to have read Saufeius' note. Ι am think-
ing of leaving Pompeii on the tenth of May.

CICERO TO ATTICUS.

Here at Pompeii on the seventh of May Ι received POvlpet't',
two letters, one five days old, the other three. So May 8, B·c·
I will answer the earlier first. How glad Ι am 44
Barnaeus delivered the letter so opportunely !

Take Cassius in hand like everything else. It is
however very lucky that 1 had written to him
