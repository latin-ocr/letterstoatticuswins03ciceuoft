LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 5

V

elcERo TO ATTleus, GREETlNG.

My messenger has returned from Brutus, bringing Tusculum,
a letter from him and from Cassius too. They want May 28, mc.
my advice badly,and Brutus asks which of two courses 44
he ought to pursue. Aias! 1 have not the remotest
idea what to say. So Ι think Ι shall keep silent, un-
less you think 1 must not. 1f anything occurs to you,
please write. Cassius, indeed, begs and beseeches
me to make Hirtius as sound as possible. Do you
think he is in his senses? It’s fairy gold!1 1 am
sending his letter.

Balbus and Oppius tell me the same as you about
the province to be assigned by the Senate to Brutus
and Cassius, and Hirtius says he will not attend—he
is here at Tusculum—and he strongly advises me to
keep away. He does so on the strength of the danger
which he says there has been even for him; but,
even if there be no danger, Ι am so far from earing
to avoid giving Antony a suspicion that Ι do not
rejoice in his prospersty, that the very reason why Ι
would rather not go to Rome is to avoid seeing him.
But our friend Varro has sent me a letter from some-
body or other-I don't know who, as he has erased
the name—telling him that the vetemus whose claims
have been put off (for some of them have been dis-
banded) are using most criminal language, saying
that those who seem not to favour their claims will
be in great danger at Rome. What, 1 should like to
know, can our goings and comings‚ our looks and our
demeanour, be among them? If again, as you say,

disappointment ; cf. Lucian, Zeuxis, ‘2 ε Timon, 41.
