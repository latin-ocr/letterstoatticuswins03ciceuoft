LETTERS TO AT'I‘ICUS XV. 9

IX

elesno TO A'r'rrcus, GREETING.

On the evening of the 2nd Ι received a letter from Tusculum,
Balbus telling me there would be a meeting of the June 2, ac.
Senate on the 5th to send Brutus to Asia, and Cassius 44
to Sicily, to buy corn and send it to Rome. What a
shame! First that they should take any office from
that party, and secondly, if any, that it should be this
subordinate¹ position. Stin, I don’t know whether
it is not better than for him to sit on the banks of
his Eurotas.·2 But fate must have its way in this.
He says that at the same time a decree will be passed
assigning provinces to them and other ex-praetors.
This is certainly better than his Persian porch. For
Ι don’t want you to think I am referring to a Sparta
farther off than Lanuvium. “You can jest,” you
will say, “in such important matters? '⁸ What am I
to do? I am tired of mourning.

Good God! how the first page of your note held
me transfixed with horror! How did that violent
brawl happen in your house? But 1 am glad this
cloud passed away quickly. Ι am very eager to know
how you have fared with your sad and very difficult
conciliatory mission; for the knot cannot be un-
ravelled. We are so surrounded by force of every
kind. Brutus’ letter, which you show that you have
read, has so disturbed me, that, undeeided as I was
before, my sorrow makes me still slower at making
up my mind. But Ι will write more when 1 have
news from you. At present Ι have nothing to write,

² Brutus apparently called a. stream on his estate at Lanu-
vium “ Eurotas‚'’ and a building there the “ Persian poreh‚’'
after the river Eurotas aml the στοὰ Περσικὴ at Sparta.
