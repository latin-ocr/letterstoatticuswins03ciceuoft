LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 3-4·

have been put straight, Ι am anxious when Ι see
Dolabella’s name among them, and drafts on people
that Ι do not know among my assets: and that
makes me more uneasy than anything else. So 1
don’t think Ι was wrong in applying to Balbus quite
openly to assist me, if such a thing should happen
as my debts not coming in properly, and telling him
that Ι had commissioned you to communicate with
him in any such event. Do so, if you think fit,
especially if you are starting for Epirus.

This 1 have written just as I was embarking from
Pompeii with three ten-oared pinnaces. Brutus is
still in Nesis, Cassius at Naples. Can you like Dei-
otarus and not like Hieras? 1 When Blesamius came
to me Hieras was commissioned not to do anything
without Sextus Peducaeus' advice, but he never con-
sulted him or any of our friends. 1 should like to
kiss Attica, far off as she is: Ι was so pleased with
the good wishes she sent me through you. So please
give her my best thanks, and the same to Pilia. ’

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

As Ι told you yesterday οι· perhaps to-day—for Puteoli, ιΙηζῑ]
Quintus said he would take two days going—I went 10, mc. 44
to Nesis on the Sth: and there was Brutus. How
annoyed he was about the “ 7 th of ιῘιιῖ]].” ² It quite
upset him. So he said he would send orders for
them to advertise the beast-hunt, which is to take
place on the day aster the games to Apollo, as
on the “13th of Quinctilis.‘’ Libo came in, and he

now disowned by him after he had succeeded in getting it.
back. ² cf. Aa. XVI. 1. 38¹
