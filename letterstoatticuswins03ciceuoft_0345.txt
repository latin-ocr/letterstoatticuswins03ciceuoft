LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 12-13

Tusculum. What intolerable nuisances! Yet we put
up with them. Which of the Bruti have we to thank
for this? In Octavianus, as Ι have observed, there
is plenty of wit and plenty of spirit, and he seems
likely to be as well diSposed to our heroes as we
could wish. But it is a grave question how far we can
trust one of his age, name, heritage, and bringing
up. His father-in—law, whom Ι saw at Astura, thinks
he is not to be trusted at all. However, we must
look after him, and, if nothing else, dissociate him
from Antonius. Marcellus will be doing well if he
inculcates our views into Brutus, to whom Octavianus
seems to be well affected. ln Pansa and Hirtius,
however, he has but little trust. His disposition is
good, if it will last.

CICERO TO ATTlcus, GnEE'riNG.

On the 25th I received two letters from you. So Puteoli,
Ι will answer the former first. Ι agree with you that Oct. 25, n-C·
we need not be the first to move nor the last to 44
follow, but that we should incline to Brutus' side.
Ι have sent you my speech) and leave it to you to
keep it or publish it. But when shall we see the day
when you will think it right to publish it? I don’t
understand how the truce you mention can be pos-
sible. It is better to make no reply3 and that, Ι
think, is what 1 shall do. You say that two legions
have arrived at Brundisium: you get all the news first.
So you must write whatever you hear. Iam expecting
Varro's dialogue.2 Ι agree now about writing some-
thing in Heracleides’ style,3 especially as you like it

¹ A promised dialogue in which Cicero was to take part, or
which was to be dedicated to him. ³ Of. xV. 4.
