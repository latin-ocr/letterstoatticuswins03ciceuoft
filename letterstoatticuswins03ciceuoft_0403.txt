LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 5

of it, he was very pressing for me to go bail to you
that he will come up to your and our expectations
for the future3 and he did not ask you to believe
this at once, but that you should restore your affee-
tion to him, when you had seen it for yourself. If he
had not convinced me of it, and 1 did not think that
what Ι am saying is trustworthy, Ι should not have
done what Ι am going to tell you. 1 took the young
man with me to Brutus, and he was so convinced of
whatl mention that he believed it on his own account,
refusing to hold me sponsor for Quintus. He praised
him and mentioned you in the most friendly way,
and dismissed him with an embrace and a kiss. So,
although there is more reason for congratulating you
than asking favours of you, still I do ask you, if you
have regarded his actions up to now as showing some
of the flightiness of youth, to believe that he has
- got rid of that, and to trust me that your influence

will contribute much, or rather everything, towards

making his decision permanent.

1 have frequently thrown out a hint to Brutus
about sailing with him, but he does not seem to
jump at it as 1 thought he would. He seemed to
me rather distrait, and indeed he was, especially
about the games. But when 1 got back home, Luc-
ceius, who is very intimate with him, said he was
hesitating a good deal, not because he has changed
his mind, but in the hope that something may turn
up. So 1 am wondering whether to make for Venusia
and there await news of the troops. If they are
not there, as some think, Ι shall go to Hydrus; if

’neither road is safe, I will come back here. Do you
think 1 am joking? Upon my life you are the only
person who keeps me here. Just look round you,
but do it before Ι blush.¹ Lepidus‘ choice of his day
