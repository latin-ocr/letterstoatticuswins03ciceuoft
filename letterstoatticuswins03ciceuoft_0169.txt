LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 22-23

prieties.1 There was no necessity for you to dun
my secretary Tullius; I should have told you, if
there had been. For he has nothing of mine to-
wards carrying out my νονν.2 But he has some of
my money, and that I am thinking of devoting to
that purpose. So we were both right,I in telling
you where it was, and he in denying he had it. But
let us get hold of this same money also at once. Ι do
not very much approve of a grove for mortals, as it is
not much frequented ; but there is something to say
for it. However, let that too be as you like, since
you decide everything. I shall come to town when
Iarranged, and Ι hope to goodness you will be there
the same day. But, if anything prevents you, and
lots of things may, the next day at any rate. For
there are my co-heirs, and without your shrewdness
I shall be done for. This is the second letter with
no news of Attica. But that I take as a hopeful
sign. There is one thing I have a grievance about,
not against you, but against her, that she does not
even send her regards. But pay my best respects to
her and to Pilia, and don't hint that I am angry
anyhow. 1 am sending Caesar’s letter, in case you
should not have read it.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

The morning’s letter Ι answered yesterday at Tusculum,
once, now Ι am answering yours of the evening. I July 10,
would rather Brutus had asked me to Rome. It ae. 45

Caesar opposed the marriage. Most editors however adopt
Orelli’s reading in utraque, in which case it would mean
“ though Brutus is attentive to both.''

of the shrine.
