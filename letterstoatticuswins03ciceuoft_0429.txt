LETTERS To ATTICUS XVI. 11-12

About the holidays for Lepidus' inauguration,¹
Balbus tells me they will last till the 29th. Ι am
looking for a letter from you, and hope l shall hear
about that little affair of Torquatus. I am sending
Quintus’ letter to show you how strong his affection
is for the youth for whom he regrets you have so
little: Please give Attica a kiss in my name for
being such a merry little thing. It is the best sign
in children.

exemto TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

1 am sending you a copy of Oppius’ letter, because Puteoli,
it is so very courteous. About Ocella, while you Nov. 6, ac.
are messing about and not writing me a line, 144
have consulted my own wits, and so I think I shall
be in Rome on the 12th. Ι think it better for
me to come there to no purpose, even if it is not
necessary, than not to be there if it is, and at
the same time Ι am afraid of being shut in there.

For Antony may always be getting near. However,
there are plenty of different rumours, which I hope
may be true; there is no definite news. For my
part, whatever it may be, I would rather be with
you, than be in suspense both about you and about
myself‚ when 1 am away from you. But what am
I to say to you? Keep up your beart. About
Varro’s work in Heracleides' vein, that’s an amusing
business. I was never so pleased with anything.
But of this and more important things when we

meet.
¹ As Pontifex Maximus.
