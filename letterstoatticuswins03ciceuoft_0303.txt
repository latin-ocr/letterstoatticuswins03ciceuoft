LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XIV. 21

there seems no doubt that things are tending
towards war. For the deed was done with the
courage of men, but with the blind policy of a
child. For who did not see that the tyrant left
an heir? And what could be more absurd than
“ to fear the one, and reck not of his friend '’ ? Nay
even now there are many absurdities. Think of
the mother of the tyrannicide1 occupying Pontius'
house at Naples! Ι must keep on reading my
Cato Major which is dedicated to you: for old age
is beginning to make me ill-tempered. Every-
thing puts me in a rage. However, my life is
over: the young people must look out for them-
selves. Take care of my affairs for me, as you
are doing.

Thin Ι have written or rather dictated when at
dessert with Vestorius. To-morrow Ι am thinking
of paying a visit to Hirtius, the only survivor of
the band of five.² That is my way of trying to
make him join the conservative party. lt is all
nonsense: there is none of Caesar’s party who
does not fear peace. So let us look for our seven-
league boots. Anything is better than a camp.

Please pay my best respects to Attica. 1 am
looking for Octavius’ speech and any other news
there may be, but especially whether we shall
hear the ring of Dolabella’s money or whether he
repudiated his debts in my case.3
