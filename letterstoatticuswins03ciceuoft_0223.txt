LETTERS To ATTICUS XIII. 48—49

XLVIII

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

Yesterday in the midst of all the noise 1 think Tusculum,

corrected. I have hurried about it, so that, if it
should be sent to young Domitius or to Brutus,
this edition should be sent. If it is convenient,
Ι should much like you to see about it, and please
send me the orations of M. Varro, and Ollius, at
any rate that of Ollius. I have read it, but I want
to dip into it again ι for there are things in it that Ι
can hardly believe I read.

for deserting Phamea, when I had undertaken thss
