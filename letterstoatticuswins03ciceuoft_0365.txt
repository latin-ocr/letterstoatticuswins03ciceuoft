LETTERS TO ATTlCUS XV. 20

XX

cxcERO To ATTICUS, GREE'HNG.

Ι have thanked Vettienus3 for nothing could have Tusculum,
been kinder. Let Dolabella give me what commis- June 17 ιο
sions he will, provided Ι have something, even a 21, ιο, 44
message to Nicias. For, as you say, who will deny
it? Can any sane man doubt now that Ι am going
away in despair, not on a mission? You say that
people, aye, even good citizens, are talking of des-
perate politica] measures. I began to have my doubts
on the day that l heard that tyrant called “a most
distinguished man.’' Afterwards, when Ι was with
you at Lanuvium and saw that our friends had pre-
cisely so much hope of life as Antony gave them, I
lost all hope. So, my dear Atticus, l hope you will
take what I am going to say with the same courage
as Ι write it. As I think the kind of death towards
which the current of affairs is Setting is disgraceful
and hold that we are practically condemned to it by
Antony, I have decided to escape from the toils,
not so much to escape as in hope of a better death.
All this is Brutus' fault.

You say Pompeius has been received at Carteia.
So there will soon be an army sent against him.
T hen which camp am Ι to choose? For Antony
makes neutrality impossible. T hat is weak, this is
criminal. So let me hasten away. But give me your
counsel whether to sail from Brundisium or Puteoli.
Brutus does wisely to go, but it is sudden. I am
rather upset about it, for when shall Ι see him again?
But such is life. You yourself cannot see him.
Heaven confound that dead man for ever touching
Buthrotum. But away with the past; let us see
what has to be done. 349
