LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVl. 15

open my arms to the youth, the whole cause, and
the troop of veterans, that Ι could not do anything
of the kind, until I had made sure that he would
not only not be an enemy, but would be a friend to
the tyrannicides. He said that would be so, and Ι
replied: “ Then, what is the hurry? He does not
want my assistance before the lst of January, and
we shall see what he intends before the middle of
December in Casca’s case.'' He quite agreed with
me. So that’s enough of that. For the rest you
will have messengers every day, and Ι think you will
have something to write every day too. Ι am sending
a copy of Lepta’s letter, and from it you will see
that that toy captain¹ has had a fall. But you will
judge for yourself when you have read it.

When I had already sealed this letter, I got one
from you and one from Sextus. Nothing could have
been pleasanter or more amiable than Sextus’ letter.
For yours was a short note, the earlier one having
been very full. lt is wise and friendly advice you
give me to stay here by preference, till we hear how
this disturbance is going to end. But just at this
minute, my dear Atticus, it is not the Republic that
Ι am bothered about—not that any thing is or ought
to be dearer to me, but even Hippocrates admits it
is useless to apply medicine in desperate cases. So
let that go hang—it is my private concerns that
bother me. Concerns, do Ι say? Nay, rather my
credit3 for, though Ι have such big balances‚ Ι have
not even enough money on hand yet to pay Terentia.
Do 1 speak of Terentia? You know we arranged
long ago to pay' Montanus’ debt of ο-82502 My son
very considerately begged me to do it out of his
credit. As you also agreed, I promised quite freely,

¹ Antony. ² 25 sestertia.
