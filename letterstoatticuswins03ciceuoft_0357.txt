LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 16-17

cxcssno To A'r'ricus, Gnnn'rmo.

At last a messenger from my son, and upon my Antium,
word a letter written in first class style. That itself June 11 or
shows some advance, and other people send most 12, ac. 44
favourable reports ton. Leonides, however, still sticks
to his “at present,‘'1 while Herodes bestows the
highest praise. Indeed, in this respect Ι gladly allow
myself even to be hoodwinked, and am not sorry to
be credulous. Ι should like you to let me know if
Statius has written anything that concerns me.

elcmno To AT‘mcus, anamma.

I tell you what, this place is lovely, and certainly Arpinum,
it is retired and free from overlookers, if you want May 19 or
to write. But somehow or other there’s no place 20, 13.c. 44
like home.2 So my feet are carrying me back to
Tusculum. And after all the tameness of this bit
of coast would probably soon cloy on one. Resides,

I am afraid of rain, if our Prognostics³ are right, sor
the frogs are holding forth. Please let me know
where Brutus is and when Ι can see him.

elcmno ΤΟ A'r'rlcus, GREETING.

1 received two letters on the l4th, one dated the Antias,
same day, one the day before. So 1 answer the earlier June 14, 13.c.
first. Tell me about D. Brutus, when you know. I 44
had heard of the pretended terror of the consuls.⁴

C ⁴ ᾘιε] were afraid-of violence on the part of Brutus and
assius.
