LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XV. 29

you make about Attica’s ill-health. When Ι meet
Brutus Ι will tell you all about him. I hope you are
right about Plancus and Decimus. Ι am sorry if
Sextus is throwing down his shield. Give me news
of Mundus if you have any. Ι have answered all
your points: now for my own news.

Young Quintus is coming with me as far as Puteoli
—what a noble citizen! you might call him a Fa-
vonius Asinius.1 He has two reasons: he wants to
be with me and to make peace with Brutus and
Cassius. But what have you to say to this? For
I know you are intimate with the Othones. He
says that J ulia proposed it herself, for a divorce has
been arranged. His father has asked me what sort
of reputation she has. Not knowing why he asked,
Ι said I had never heard anything about her except
about her looks and her father. “But why?'’ 1
asked: and he said his son wanted her. Then, though
I was disgusted, I said Ι did not believe in those
reports. My brother’s point is not to offer him any
allowance, but she says it is no business of his. 1
suspect, however, he is indulging in fairy tales as
usual. Still I should like you to make enquiries,
which will be 110 trouble to you, and let me know.

What, pray, is this? When I had already sealed
this letter, some Formians, who were dining with
me, said they had seen Plancus2—the one from Bu-
throtus—the day before I wrote this, that is, on the
5th, with downcast mien and unapparelled steed;³
and that his boys said he and the land-grabbers had
been ejected by the Buthrotians. Well done they!
But pray let me know all the circumstances.
