LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XIII. 37

XXXVII

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

This is the second letter to-day. About Xeno's Tusculum,
debt and the ‚4:401 owing to you in Epirus, things Aug. 2, uc.
could not happen more conveniently than you say 45
they are happening in your letter. Balbus the
younger suggested the same to me the other
day. I have no news except that Hirtius has been
taking my part most valiantly in arguments against
young Quintus. The latter is raving about me
everywhere, especially at dinner-parties, and then
he falls back on his father: nothing he says is so
likely to be believed as that we are utterly irre-
concilable to Caesar3 that we are not to be trusted,
and that l ought to be held in suspicion, which
would have been terrifying, if were I not aware
that the king knows I have no spirit left. He says
too that my son is being bullied by me: but that he
may say as much as he likes. I am glad I sent the
funeral oration of Porcia to Lepta the messenger
before 1 got your letter. So, as you love me, have
it sent to Domitius and Brutus in the form you
suggest, if it is to be sent at all.

About the gladiatorial games and the things which
you call airy nothings send me news day by day. 1
should like you to apply to Balbus and Offilius, if
you think fit. About giving notice of the auction
I have spoken with Balbus. He agreed—I imagine
Offilius has a complete list, and so has Balbus—wel]
Balbus agreed for a day near at hand and for Rome
as the place: if Caesar puts off coming, the day
might be defen-ed. But he seems to be close at
hand. So think it all over; for Vestorius is content.
