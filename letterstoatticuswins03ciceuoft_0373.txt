LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 24-25

XXIV

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlCUS, GREETING.

The messenger I sent to Brutus just got back Tusculum,
yesterday. Servilia told him Brutus had started at June 26, as.
half-past six in the morning. I was very sorry he 44
did not get my letters. Silius has not come yet. 1
have drawn up a statement of his case, and am
sending the pamphlet to you. Ι should like to know
when to expect you.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

Opinions differ about my joui-ney, for I have had a Tusculum,

lot of visitors. But please apply yourself to the June 29, ac.
question. lt is a serious matter. Do you approve 44
of my idea of returning by the lst of January? l
am open-minded on the subject, provided 1 don’t
give any offence. By the way, too, do you know
the date of the sacrilege of yore?¹ However that
may be, chance will decide the plan of my Journey.
So let us leave it in doubt. For a winter journey is
most unpleasant, and that was why Ι asked you the
date of the mysteries.² Brutus, as you say, Ι think 1
shall see. Iwant to leave here on the last of the
month.

¹ If the reading is right, which is very uncertain, thia
must refer to the violation of the ritea of Bona Dea by
Clodius in cicero’s consulship. It. may, however, refer to
the Olympio gamen as Shuekburgh suggests.

¹ Vide last note. Shuckburgh, however, thinks it refers
to the Eleusiniam myster-ies.
