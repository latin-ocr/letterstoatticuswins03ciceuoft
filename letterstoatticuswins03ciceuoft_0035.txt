LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XII. 6a-7

at your use of quaeso, as rather quaint and cockneyfled.
He bade you have no anxiety in such a way that
Ι had no doubts left.1 I am sorry Attica’s attack
lasts so long: but, as she has lost her shivering fits
now, Ι hope it will be all right.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ι have scribbled a note with all you want on a Tusculum,

tablet, and given it to Eros—quite shortly, but intercalavy
more than you ask for. In it I have spoken about mouth, uc.
my son, of whose intentions you gave me the first 46
hint. Ι took a most liberal tone with him, and, if
you think it convenient, I should like you to ask
him about that. But why put it off? I pointed out
that you had told me what he wished to do and
what he wanted: “he wished to go to Spain, and
wanted a liberal allowance.’' As for the allowance,
1 said I would give him as much as Publilius or
Lentulus the flamen gave their sons. Against Spain
Ι brought forward two arguments, the first, tlte one
I used to you, that I was afraid of adverse criticism :
“ Was it not enough that we abandoned one side?
Must we take the other?” The second that he
would be annoyed, if his cousin enjoyed Caesar's
intimacy and general goodwill more than he did.
Ι should prefer him to make use of my liberal offer
rather than of his liberty. However Ι gave him
permission 5 for 1 saw you did not really dislike the
idea. I shall think the matter over carefully. and
1 hope you will too. It is an important point: to
stay is simple, to go risky. But we shall see.
