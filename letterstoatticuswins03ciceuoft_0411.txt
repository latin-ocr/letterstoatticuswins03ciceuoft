LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 7

consuls and ex-praetorsusking them to be present. ⁴
They said there were great hopes that Antony
might yield, some agreement be arrived at, and
our friends allowed to return to Rome3 and they
added that I was missed and people were inclined
to blame me.

When I heard that, Ι had no hesitation about
giving up my idea of going away, which to be
sure 1 had never fancied even before that: and
when I read your letter, I was certainly surprised
that you had so utterly changed your opinion;
but there seemed to me to be good reason for it.
However, though it was not you who persuaded
and urged me to g0, you certainly approved of
my going, if I got back by the end of the year.
That would have meant, that, when there was
little danger, I should have been away, and should
return when it was in full blaze. But that, although
it was not a counsel of prudence, I have no right
to resent, first because it happened by my own
wish, and secondly‚ even if you had advised me,
an adviser need not guarantee anything but his
sincerity. What did astonish me beyond measure ·
was that you should use the words: “A fine thing
for you, who talk of a noble death, a fine thing,
i’ saith. Go, desert your country.” Was I deserting
it, or did you at the time think 1 was deserting it?
You not only raised no finger against it, you even
approved of it. The rest is even more severe:
“ I wish you would write me an explanatory note
showing that it was your duty to do it?” So,
my dear Atticus? Does my aetion need defending,
especially to you, who expressed strong approval?
Yes, 1 will write a defence, but for some of those
who opposed my going and spoke against it.
