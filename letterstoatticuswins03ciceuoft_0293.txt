LETTERS To ATTlCUS XIV. 19

four days ago, as you advise, and had sent a copy
of my letter to you. But when I was in the depths
of despair owing to Dolabella’s arice1 (for that is
what you wrote), lo and behold your letter and
Brutus’. Brutus is meditating exile. Ι however
see another haven and a readier one for my age: but
1 would rather sail into it with Brutus in prosperity
and the republic set in order. But now, as you say,
Ι have not the choice. For you agree that age unfits
me for a soldier's camp, especially in civil war.

Antony only answered about Clodius, that my
leniency and clemency had been very gratifying
to him and would be a source of pleasure to myself.
But Pansa appears to be in a fury about Clodius
and about Deiotarus too3 and, if you are willing
to believe him, he expresses himself very forcibly.
But there is one thing that to my mind is shady,
that he strongly disapproves of Dolabella’s action.
As for the people who wore garlands, when your
nephew was reproved for it by his father, he
answered that he wore a garland for Caesar’s
honour, and laid it aside for grief ; and finally
that he would willingly submit to reproaches for
loving Caesar even after his death.

To Dolabella Ι have written carefully, as you
advise: and'l have written myself to Sicca too.
l do not want to lay this burden on you, for Ι
don't want him to be angry with you. 1 recognise
Servius’ way of talking; and there seems to me
to be more fright than wisdom in it. But, since
we are all frightened, I agree with Servius.
Publilius has been hoaxing. For Caerellia was sent
here by them as their ambassadress to me;² but

² '1⁹0 persuade Cicero to remarry his divorced wife Publilia.
