CICERO TO C. CUPIENNIUS, GREETING.

Ι was a great admirer of your father, and he was Written at
exceedingly attentive and affectionate to 1ne3 and Ι tlze same time
am sure Ι have never had any doubt that you have a as 160
regard for me. Certainly Ι have never ceased to
have one for you. So Ι beg you with more than
usual earnestness to assist the city of Buthrotum,
and to make it your business that our friend Plancus
should confirm and verify the deeree which the
consuls made in favour of the Buthrotians, when
they had been granted the power of settling the
question both bya statute and by a senatorial deeree.

This 1 do most earnestly beg and entreat you, my
dear Cupiennius.

menno TO PLANCUS, PRAETOR ELECT, GREE'HNG.

Pardon me for writing again on the same subject, Written
when Ι have already written very fully to you about aster 16b
the Buthrotians. Ι do assure you, my dear Plancus,
that 1 do not do so because Ihave little faith in your
generosity or your friendship for me. But my friend
Atticus has so great a monetary stake in the matter3
and now, what is more, his very reputation is in-
volved in showing that he can obtain what Caesar
approved of, and we, who were present when Caesar
made his deci-ees and gave his answer, witnessed and
sealed. And 1 appeal to you especially, because it
is a case where the whole power, l will not say of
confirming, but of confirming sreely and willingly
