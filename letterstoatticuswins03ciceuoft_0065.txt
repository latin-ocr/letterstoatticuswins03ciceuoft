LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 22-23

rate from Postumia, the former from M. Cotta οι·
Syrus or Satyrus.

About the gardens Ι earnestly entreat your aid.
1 must employ all my own resources and those of
friends, who 1 know will not desert me: but Ι
can manage with my own. There are things Ι
could sell easily too. But without selling anything,
if Ι pay interest to the person from whom Ι buy for
no more than a year, Ι can get what Ι want, if you
assist me. The most available are those of Drusus,
as he wants to sell. The next Ι think are Lamia's3
but he is away. However scent out anything you
can. Silius again never uses his at all, and he will
very easily be satisfied with the interest. Regard
it as your own business, and don’t consider what
suits my purse, for that I don't care, but what

suits me.

cwzno ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

From the beginning of your letter “though I did Astura,
not care what happened in Spain, still you would March 19,
write‚'’ 1 thought you had some news from me: but ac, 45
Ι see you have answered my letter only as regards
the forum and the Senate. But, you say, my house
at Rome is a forum. What is the good of the house
alone to me, if Ι have not the forum? Ι am dead
and done for, Atticus, and have been this long
while: but now Ι confess it, when I have lost the
one link that bound me to life. So what Ι want is
solitude. Still if in my despite anything drags me to
Rome, I shall strive, if possible (and I will make it
possible), to keep my grief from all eyes but yours‚
and, if it is anyhow possible, even from yours.
