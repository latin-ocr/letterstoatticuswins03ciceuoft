LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 20-21

Though 1 have not yet seen Eros, from his letters
aud from what Tiro found out Ι know pretty well
how his accounts stand. You say I must raise a fresh
loan for some 32900 for five months, that is, till the
lst of November, when Quintus’ debt falls due. So,
since Tiro says you do not want me to come to Rome on
purpose for that, if you do not mind, I should be glad
if you would see where Ι can get the money, and put
it down on my account. 1 see it is necessary for the
present. I will enquire more closely into the rest from
Eros himself, among other things about the rents of
Terentia's dower property. 1f they are properly looked
after for my son he will be pretty well provided for,
though Ι want him to be more liberally treated. I see
I shall want some journey-money myself; but he can
get the rents of the property as they fall due, where-
as Ι shall require a lump sum. Ι certainly shall not
leave until the money has been paid, though that
trembler at shadowsl seems to me to be meditating
a massacre. However, whether it has been arranged
or not, I shall learn when Ι see you. I thought 1
had better write this myself, and so Ι have done so,
As you say about Fadius: the money must not go to
anyone else in any case. Please answer by return.

Ι must tell you my brother Quintus is juniping for Tusculum
joy. For his son has written saying that his reason June 22,
for wanting to take refuge with Brutus ιε, that, when Β c 44
Antony asked him to secure him the dictatorship
and seize some fort, he refused, and the reason for

¹ Antony, who professed to be afraid of assassination at
the hands of Brutus and Cassius. Cf. XV. 17.
