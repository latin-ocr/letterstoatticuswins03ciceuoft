LETTERS TO ATTlCUS X11. 45-46

more han-owed by galling memories here than
there ; though to be sure, wherever Ι am, they are
with me. l wrote to you about your “ neighbour ”
caesar, because 1 learned about it from your
letters. 1 would rather see him sharing the temple
of Quirinus than of Safety.1 Yes, publish Hirtius'
book. Ι thought the same as you say, that our
friend’s talent was shown by it, while its object,
blackening Cato’s character, only looked ridiculous.

XLVI

CICERO TO ATTlcus,GREss-.T1No.

I think Ι shall conquer my feelings and go from Astura, Mar
Lanuvium to Tusculum. For I must either give 15, nnc 45
up that estate for ever (for my grief will remain
the same, only less visible), or it does not matter
a straw whether I go there now or ten years
hence. The place-will not remind me of her any
more than the thoughts that harass me day and
night. “OM” you will say, “so books do not
help.” In this respect I am afraid they make it
worse: perhaps Ι should have been braver without.

For in a cultivated mind there is no roughness
and no insensibility.

So you will come to me as you said, and only
that if convenient. A letter apiece will be enough.
Ι will even come to meet you, if necessary. So
that shall be as you find possible.
