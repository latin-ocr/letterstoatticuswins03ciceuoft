LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 13

know what practice that lot have had in rascality,
and how reckless they are.

That pretty fellow Dolabella has written to me
from Formiae, though, when Ι was writing this letter
at dessert, 1 heard he had arrived at Baiae, and Ι got
his letter as Ι left my bath. He says he has done
· his level best about assigning debts to me. He
blames Vettienus—-of course he is up to some dodge
like a true business man—but he says Sestius, who
is a very honest fellow and a good friend of mine,
has undertaken the whole affair. Still, 1 should like
to know what on earth Sestius can do in this business
that any of us could not have done. But if anything
does happen contrary to my expectation, you must
let me know ; while, if it is, as Ι suspect, a hopeless
business, write all the same: it will not disturb me.

I am philosophizing here (what else can Ι do ?)
and getting on splendidly with my De Officiis, which
Ι am dedicating to my son. A father could not
choose a more appropriate subject. Then 1 shall
turn to other subjects. In fact this excursion will
have some works to show for itself. Varro is ex-
pected either to-day or to-morrow; but I am hasten-
ing to Pompeii, not that anything could be prettier
than this place, but I shall be less bothered by in-
terruptions there. But please inform me what the
charge was against Myrtilus,1 for I hear he has been
executed, and whether it has come out who suborned
him.

As Ι am writing this, it just occurs to me that my
speech is being delivered to you. How I sear your
judgment on it! Though what does it matter to me,
as it will not be published, unless the constitution is
restored? And what hope 1 have of that l dare
not say.
