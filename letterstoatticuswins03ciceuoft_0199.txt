LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XIII. 34-35,36

should settle with Publilius in my absence :¹ and
about that you will let me know what people say.
“Of course the world is all agog with that!” On
my honour Ι don't think so; for the nine days'
wonder is over. But Ι wanted to fill the page.
What need of more: for Ι am almost with you,
unless you put me off for a bit. For I have written
to you about the gardens.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

What a shame! A countryman of yours² is Tusculum,
enlarging the city, which he had never seen two July 13,
years ago, and he thinks it too small to hold the uc. 45
great man alone. On that point then I am expect-
ing a letter from you. You say you will present my
book to Varro, as soon as he arrives. So they are
already given and you have no choice left. Ah,
if you but knew what a risk you are running!

Or perhaps my letter stopped you, unless you had
not read it, when you wrote your last letter. So
I am eager to know how the matter stands.

As to Brutus’ affection and your walk, though you
give me no actual news, but only a repetition of
what has often happened, yet the more often 1
hear it, the gladder 1 am3 and I find it the more
gratifying, because you enjoy it, and the more certain,
because you tell me of it.

² About Cicero’s divorce from Publilia.
