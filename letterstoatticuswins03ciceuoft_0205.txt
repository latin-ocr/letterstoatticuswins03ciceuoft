LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 38-39

abjure the fellow, or shall 1 act “ with wiles ''? For,
like Pindar's, “my mind divided cannot truly tell.’'
The first would suit my character best, of course, but
the second perhaps the times. But take it Ι have
made up my mind to do whatever you have made
up your mind to do. Ι am horribly afraid of being
caught at Tusculum. It would be more comfortable
in company. At Astura then? What if Caesar
arrives unexpectedly? Please assist me with advice.
Ι will do what you decide.

XXXIX

ommno TO ATTICUS, GRERTING.

What incredible hypocrisy ! To write to his father Tusculum,
that “he had no home owing to his mother,'’ and Aug. 5, ac.
to his mother a letter full of affection. His father 45
however is already cooling down and says the son
has a right to be angry with him. But Ι will
follow your advice; for I see “crooked ways” are
what you favour. Ι will come to Rome, as you
think I ought, though against my will; for I cannot
tear myself from my writing. You say I shall
find Brutus on the way: of course, but without this
other reason that would not be strong enough to
move me. For he has not come from the place
Ι, should wish, nor has he been long away or sent
me any letter. Still I should like to know the
result of his whole journey. Please send me the
books 1 asked for before, especially Phaedrus On the
Gods and On Pallas.
