LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 15-16

1 hand over the villa and all there is in it to
our dear Pilia, as Ι am sctting out for Pompeii
on the lst of May. How I wish you could persuade
Brutus to come to Astura Ξ

CICERO ΤΟ AT'rlcus, GREETmo.

1 despatch this letter on the 3rd, as 1 embark Puteoli,
in a rowing boat from Cluvius' gardens, after ssluy 3, u.c.
handing over the villa at the Luci-ine lake to Pilia 44
with its servants and care-takers. Myself I am
threatening our friend Paetus’ cheese and herrings
for that day; in a few days 1 am going to Pompeii
and after that sailing back to my domains here
at Puteoli and Cumae. What very attractive places
they are, if it were not that one almost has to shun
them on account of the crowd of visitors.

But to return to the point, what a magnificent
stroke of our friend Dolabella! How it will make
people open their eyes. For my part l keep on
praising and encouraging him. You are right in
what you say in every letter about the deed and
about the man. To me it seems that our friend
Brutus could walk through the forum with a golden
crown on his head now. For who would dare to
hurt him with the cross and rock before his eyes,
especially when the rabble have shown such applause
and approbation ?

Now, my dear Atticus, do put things straight
for me. I want to run over to Greece, as soon
as 1 have quite satisfied Brutus. It is a matter
of great concern to my son, or rather to me, or upon

my word to both of uS‚ that I should drop in uggxli.
