LETTERS TO AT'l'ICUS XV. 7-8

his secretary, seems to have undet-taken an embassy
and to be on his guard against all the quips and
quiddities of the law. But he ought to realize that
it is not a case of “joining hands in legal claim,'’
but of what follows.'’ ¹ Please write.

cicsno το umens, anamma.

Aster you had left came two letters from Balbus, Tusculum,
with no news in them, and one from Hirtius, who May 31, ac
says he is very annoyed with the veterans. My mind 44
is still anxious about what Ι shall do about the lst.
So Ι have sent Tiro and some men with him—please
give them letters one by one, as things happen—and
Ι have written to Antony about the legation‚ for sear
that, if 1 had written only to Dolabella, his quick
temper might be aroused. But, as it is said to be
rather difficult· to get an audience with him, 1 have
written to Eutrapelus, so that he may deliver my
letter. Imust have an embassy: a votive embassy
is more honourable, but I could use either.

Your own position, 1 beg you, review most care-
fully. 1 wish we could do so together-3 if not, we
must accomplish it by letters. Graeceius has written
to me that he has heard from Cassius that armed
men are being got ready to be sent to my house
at Tusculum. I don’t think that is the case; but
still Ι must take care to have m‘ore safeg'uards
ready. But to-morrow may give us some food for
reflection.

uncertain3 possibly to patch up peace between Antony and
caesar‘a murdereru.
