LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. ιιι-[ια

master to run away from, since the death of a master
has not set us free. Ι blush, believe me; but 1 have
written it, and 1 won’t erase it.

1 wish it had been true about Menedemus, and 1
hope it may be true about Cleopatra. The rest when
we meet, and especially what our friends must do,
and what even we must do, if Antony is going to sur-
round the House with soldiers. 1 was afraid he might
open this letter, if I gave it to his messengers‚ soI
have sent it with special care, for I had to answer

yours.

cremo 'ro A'r'l'lcus, anamma.

How l wish you could have rendered your service Tusculum,
to Brutus! So l am writing to him. l have sent May 27, 3.st
Tiro to Dolabella with a message and a letter. 44
Summon him to you, and, if you have any pleasant
news, write. But here is a letter from L. Caesar all
of a sudden, asking me to come to him at the Grove ¹
or write where I should like to meet him: Brutus
wants me to see him. What a nuisance and what a
surprise! Ι suppose then 1 must go, and from there
on to Rome, unless 1 change my mind. At present
I am only sending you a short note, sor Ι have not
heard yet from Balbus. So I am looking for a letter
from you to tell me not only what has happened but
what is going to happen.
