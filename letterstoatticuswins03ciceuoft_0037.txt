LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS ΧΙΙ. 7-9

About Balbus Ι have written in the tablet, and 1
think of doing as you say, as soon as he comes back.
1f he is rather slow about it, still 1 shall be three
> days there3 and, Ι foi-got to say, Dolabella will be
with me too.

clctno ΤΟ A'r‘rrcus, GREETING.

My plan for my son meets with general approval. Tusculum.
1 have found a suitable companion.1 But let us first intercalary ν
see to the payment of an instalment of Tullia‘s mouth, n.c.
dowry. The time is near and Dolabella is in a 46
hurry. Please write and tell me what Celer says
Caesar has settled about the candidates, whether he
thinks of going to the field of Fennel or the field of
Mars.2 Ishould much like to know too whether I
must come to Rome for the elections. For Ι must
do my duty by Pilia and anyhow by Attica.

elcEno ΤΟ ATTICUS, onEETmo.

1 should be pei-fectly comfortable here and become Astura, July
more and more so every day, if it weren’t for the 27, B.c. 45
reason I mentioned in my former letter. Nothing
could be pleasanter than this solitude, except for
the occasional interruptions of Amyntas’ son.3 How
his chatter does bore one! All the rest is more
charming than you can imagine, the villa, the shore,

electioris at Rome take place? The campus Fenicularius was
ne? Γιῖα 1lialjcfzircius Philippus, justingly referred to as Philip,
king of Macedonia.
