LETTERS TO ATTICUS xll. 49

XLIX

menno TO ATTICUS, antummo-

1 felt all the time how much good your presence Tusculum,
was doing me· but Ι feel it still more since you have May 19, Β. (·.
gone. So, as I wrote to you before, either I must 45
come to you entirely or you to me, according as it
can be managed.

Yesterday, soon after your departure, I think,
some people, who looked like city men, brought
me a message and a letter from Gaius Marius, son
and grandson of Gaius.1 He begged me in the
name of our relationship, in the name of Marius,
on whom Ι had written, and by the eloquenee of
his grandfather, L. Crassus, to defend him: and he
stated his ease in full. Ι wrote back that he had
no need of an advocate since his relative Caesar
was omnipotent, and he was the best and most
liberal of men: but I would support him. What
times these are! To think of Curtius wondering
whether to stand for the consulship. But enough
of this.

Ι am anxious about Tiro. But 1 shall know soon
how he is, for yesterday I sent a man to see, and
1 gave him a letter to you too. Ι have sent you
a letter for my son. Please tell me for what day
the sale of the gardens' ιε advertised.

Marius married J uha aunt of Caesam their son was adopted
by Gratidia, grandmother of Cicero, and married a. daughter
of L. Crassus, the orator. Hence the olaims of relationship
asserted· in th’is letter
