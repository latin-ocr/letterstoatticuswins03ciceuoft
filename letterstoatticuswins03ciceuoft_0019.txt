CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

On the eleventh day after parting from you l Arpinum,
have scribbled these few lines while leaving my N01;23,n.c.
country house before daybreak. I am thinking of 46
stopping to-day at my place at Anagnia, to-morrow
at Tusculum and staying there one day. On the
26th then to our tryst3 and Ι only wish Ι could
run straight to the embraces of my Tullia and the
lips of Attica. What those little lips are prattling,
please write and let me know, while I am at Tuscu-
lum, or, if she is in the country, what she is writing
to you: and in the meantime pay my respects by
letter or in person to her, and to Pilia too. And
all the same, though we are to meet at once, write
to me, if you have anything to say.

As I was folding up this letter, a messenger came
in the night to me with a letter of yours, and on
reading it Ι was naturally very sorry to hear of
Attica’s slight attack of sever. Everything else 1
was wanting to hear, Ι learn from your letter. You
say it is a sign of old age to want a bit of fire in the
morning: it's a worse sign of old age to be a bit
weak in your memory. I had arranged for the 27th
with Axius, the 28th with you, and the 26th, the
day 1 arrive, with Quintus So please count on
