LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 16-17

be in you alone, and, as soon as any will be possible
from anyone, it will come from you. Yet at this
very moment Ι cannot bear your absence. But it
did not seem right to stay in your house and Ι
could not stay at my own house; and, if I stayed
somewhere nearer, still Ι should not be with you,
for you would be prevented from being with me
by the same reason that you are now. For myself,
this solitude has suited me better than anything
so far, though Ι am afraid Philippus will destroy it.
He came yesterday evening. Writing and read-
ing do not soften my feelings, they only distract
them.

CICERO TO ATTICUS,GREET1NG.

Marcianus has written to tell me that my excuses A‚·‚92ma
were made with Appuleius by Laterensis, Nam, March 12
Laenas, Torquatus and Suabo. Please send them Β c 45
a letter on my behalf, thanking them for what they
have done. As for what Flavius says, that more
than 25 years ago Ι went bail for Cornificius, though
the defendant is well off, and Appuleius is a respect-
able estate agent, Ι should be glad, if you would
verify the truth of that statement from the account
books of the other sureties3 for before my aedileship
1 had no dealings with Cornificius. It may be so:
but 1 should like to know for certain. And please
demand payment from his agents, if you think it
right. ¹ However it’s of no importance: but still—-.

Let me know when Pansa departs, when you know
yourself. Pay my respects to Attica, and pray look
after her well. Greet Pilia for me.
