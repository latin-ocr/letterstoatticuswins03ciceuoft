⁴ LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 9-10

especially as Ι have doubts as to whether you may
get this letter. For it is uncertain whether the
messenger may see you. Ι am looking for a letter

from you very eugerly.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, unm-:Tmo-

What an affectionate letter from Brutus÷ And Tusculum,

what hard luck that you cannot go to him! But June 5 or 6,
what am Ι to say? That they should accept the ac, 44
other party’s favours? That were the depth of
shame. That they should try some new move? They
dare not, and now they cannot. Well, suppose Ι
advise them to keep quiet and they do, who can
guarantee their safety? Indeed, if anything un-
pleasant happens to Decimus, what sort of life shall
we lead, even if no one molests us? It is a sad dis-
grace not to preside at the gameS.1 Fancy putting
the burden of the corn-supply on them! What is
this but promotion downwards,2 and what state office
is more contemptible ? To give advice in such matters
is certainly quite unsafe, even for those who give it.
If Ι were doing good, Ι might overlook that; but
why should I put my foot in it to no purpose? Since
he is following his mother’s advice, or rather her
supplications, why should I interfere? However, 1
will consider what kind of letter I can write, for Ι
must give some answer. So I will write at once
either to Antium or to Circeii.

² 'rho banishment of Dion from Syracuse by the younger
Dionysius under the pretext of an embassy seems to have
passed into a. proverb in this sense.
