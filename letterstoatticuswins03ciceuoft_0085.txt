*LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 32-33

auswered that Ι was even worse than when Ι told
her Ι wanted to be alone; so she must not think of
coming to me at the present time. Ι thought, if Ι
had not answered, she would come with her mother,
now Ι don't think she will. For evidently that
letter is not her own. But the thing that Ι see will
happen—that they will come to me—is the very
thing I want to avoid, and the one way of avoiding it
is for me to flee. Ι don’t want to, but Ι must. Now
I want you to find out how long I can stay without
being caught. Act as you say, with moderation.

Please suggest to my son, that is if you think it
fair, that he should keep the expenses of this
journey within the rents of my property in the
Argiletum and the Aventine, with which he would

and hired a house, as he was thinking of doing:
and, when you have made the suggestion, Ι should
like you to arrange the rest, so that we may supply
him with what is necessary from those rents. I will
guarantee that neither Bibulus nor Acidinus nor
Messalla, who 1 hear are at Athens, will spend more
than he will get out of those rents. So please see
who the tenants are and what they pay, secondly
that they are punctual payer3‚ and what journey
money and outflt will suffice. There is certainly no
need of a carriage at Athens, while for what he
wants on the journey, we have more than enough,
as you also observe.

CICERO TO ATTlcUS, GREETING.

As 1 said in my letter yesterday, if Silius is the Astura,
sort of man you think him and Drusus is hard to deal March 26,
with, I should like you to approach Damasippus. He ns.. 45
