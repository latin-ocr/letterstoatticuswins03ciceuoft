LETTERS TO ATTICUS Xlll. 28-29

see that even that pupi] of Aristotle, in spite of his
high ability and his high character, became proud,
cruel, and ungovernable, after he got the title of
king? How do you suppose this puppet messmate of
Quirinus¹ will like my moderate letters? Let him
rather look for what I do not write than disapprove
of what Ι have written. In short let it be as he
pleases. What was spurring me on when Ι put that
insoluble problem2 before you has all gone now.
Upon my word now Ι should far rather welcome the
misfortune Ι feared then or any other.

If there is nothing to prevent you, come to me
and welcome. Nicias at Dolabella’s urgent request
(for 1 read the letter) has gone, against my will
though not against my advice.

ΤΙιο rest I have written myself. When 1 was
discussing men of learning with Nicias, we chanced
to speak of Talna. He had not much to say ior his
intelligence, though he gave him a good and steady
character. But there was one thing that seemed to
me unsatisfactory. He said he knew he had lately
sought in marriage cornificia, Quintus’ daughter,
though quite an old woman and married more than
once before; but the ladies would not agree as they
found he was not worth more than 7‚000 guineas.⁸ Ι
thought you ought to know this.
