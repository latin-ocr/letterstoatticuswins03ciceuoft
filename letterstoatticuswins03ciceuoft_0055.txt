LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 18a—l9

not invite anyone she thought would ask questions,
if they did not know the contents of the will. Was 1
likely to be afraid of anything of the kind? However
let her do what I do. Ι will hand over my will to
anyone she likes, to read. She will find I could not
have treated my grandson more handsomely than
1 have. As to my not calling certain people as
witnesses, in the first place it never entered my
mind, and in the second the reason why it never
entered it, was because it was of no importance.
You know, if you remember, that 1 told you to
bring some of your friends. 'What need was there

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETtNG.

This is certainly a delightful place, right on the Amara,
sea and within sight of Antium and Circeii. But March 14,
we must remember how it may change hands an a..c 45
infinite number of times in the countless years to
come, if our empire last, and must arrange that that
shrine may remain as consecrated ground. For my
part I don't want a large income now and can be
contented with little. I think at times of buying
some gai-dens across the Tiber, especially for this
reason: I don’t see any other place that can be
so much frequented. But what gai-dens, we will
consider together3 provided only that the shrine
must be completed this summer. However settle
with Apella of Chios about the columns.
