LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. ll

of Varro3 Ι have not yet managed to get the book
in the style of Heracle-,ides from him. You exhort
me to go on writing. That is friendly of you; but
let me tell you I do nothing else. I am sorry to hear
of your cold. Please take as much care as usual of
it. Ι am glad my book On Old Age 1 does you good.
The “men of Anagnia'’² are Mustela, the swash-
buckler, and Laco, the champion toper. The book
yffiiffl ἷὲἶ Ῑιιῖἳῖἔέἐέῗέ 3¹33? ⁵332 De officiis, so ,
far as Panaetius is eoneerned, I have finished in
two books. He has three: but, though at the
beginning he makes a three—fold division of cases
in which duty has to be determined, one when the
question is between right or wrong, another when
it in between expediency and inexpediency, and
the third, how we are to decide when it is a con-
flict between duty and expediency—for example, in
Regulus’ case to return would be right, to stay ex-
pedient—he treated of the first two brilliantly; the
third he promises to add, but never wrote it. Posi-
donius took up that topic: but Ι have ordered his
book and written to Athenodorus Calvus to send me
an analysis of it, and that 1 am expecting. Ι wish
you would spur him on and beg him to let me have
it as soon as possible. In it duties under given cir-
cumstances are handled. As to your query about
the title, Ι have no doubt that καθῆκον (duty) cor-
responds with officium, unless you have any other
suggestion to make. But the fuller title is De
Officiis. 1 am dedicating it to my son. It seems
to me not inappropriate.
