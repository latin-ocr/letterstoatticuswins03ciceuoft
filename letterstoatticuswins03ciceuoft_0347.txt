LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 13

so much; but Ι will write whatever you wish. As Ι
told you before, or rather previously, as you prefer to
say, Ι must confess you have made me more eager to
write. For to your own opinion, which Ι knew, you
have added Peducaeus' authority, which Ι count great
and as weighty as any. So 1 will make an effort not
to disappoint you in my industry or diligence. Ι am
making much of Vettienus and Faberius, as you
suggest. Ι don’t ¹think Clodius meant any harm,
though—but it is nothing to me.¹ I agree with you
about preserving our liberty, our most precious pos-
session. So it is Gallus Caninius’ turn now ? 2 What
a knave! For what else can one call him? How
cautious Marcellus is. So am 1, but not over-
cautious.

Ι have answered your longer and earlier letter.
Now what can Ι say to the shorter and more recent,
except that it was most delightful? Affairs in Spain
are going really well, if only Ι can see Balbilius in
safety as a support for our old age. About Annianus³
Ι agree, as Visellia is very polite to me. But that is
the way of the world. You say you know nothing
of Brutus, but Servilia says M. Scaptius has come,
and that without any of his usual parade, and he
will pay her a visit quietly, and I shall be told every-
thing. I shall know soon. Meantime she says a slave
of Bassus has come announcing that the legions in
Alexandria are in arms, that Bassus has been sum-
moned, and Cassius is expected with eagerness. In
short it looks as though the republic was going to
recover its rights. But don't let us anticipate. You

² From Ate. xv1. 14 it appears that Gallus had just died.
Probably Antony, to whom the next words apparently refer,
threatened to confiscate his property.

⁸ Or “the estate of Anui11a,” as Shuokburgh.
