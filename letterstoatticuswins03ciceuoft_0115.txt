LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 47-48

XLVII

CICERO TO ΑἹἫΗΟΟΒ GREE'MNG.

About Mustela, do as you say, though it will be Lanuvzun,

a big business. For that reason I incline more to May 16, n..c
Clodia3 though in both cases we must find out 45
about 'F'aberius' debt. There will be no harm in

your speaking to Balbus about it and telling him,

what is the truth, that we want to buy, but can-

not without getting in that debt, and dare not,

until something is settled. But when is Clodia

going to be in Rome, and how much do you think

it will eost? Why I turn my thoughts to it is not

that 1 should not prefer the other, but it is a big

venture and it is difficult to contend with one who

is eager for it, rich and one of the heirs. As far as
eagerness goes, I yield to no one, but in the other

respects we are worse off. However of this when

we meet.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, ΟΒΕΕῚῚΝΠ.

Go on publishing Hirtius’ book. About Philotimus Lanuvium,
I agree with you. l see your house will go up in May 17, Bs-
value now you have Caesar for a neighbour. I am 45
expecting my messenger to-day. He will tell me
about Pilia and Attica.

Ι can easily believe you are glad to be at home:
but Ι should like to know what business you still
have or if you have finished now. I am expecting
you at Tusculum, especially as you told Tiro you
were coming at once, adding that you thought it
necessary.
