LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 11-12

Even you did not like the idea of a votive legati0n3
for indeed it was absurd for me to be fulfilling vows
after the constitution was overthrown‚ which I had
made in case it were maintained. I fancy, too,
free legations have a limit of time set by one os
Caesar’s laws, and it is not easy to get it prolonged.
1 want the kind of legation that lets you come and
go as you please‚ and that I have got now. It is a
fine thing, too, to have the privilege for five years.
Though why do Ι think of five years ? Things seem
to me to be drawing to a crisis : but absit omen.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

That’s jolly good news about Buthrotum. But Ι Antium,
had sent Tiro to Dolabella with a letter as you bade June 9 or 10,
me. What harm is there in it? About our friends ac, 44
at Antium, 1 think I wrote plainly enough for you
not to doubt that they are going to take things
quietly and accept Antonius’ insulting favour. Cas-
sius rejeets the corn-supply job, and Servilia says she
will cut it out of the senatorial decree. Our friend
is taking things very seriously, now he agrees with
me that he cannot be safe in Rome (for he prefers
the games to take place in his absence). He says he
will go to Asia at once, as soon as he has handed
over the management of the games to those who
will attend to it. He is collecting vessels, and his
beart is set on going. Meantime they will stay in
the same places. Brutus says he will be at Astura.

L. Antonius has sent a kind letter telling me to have
no sear. That's one thing 1 have to thank him

for; perhaps there will be another, if he comes t?
