LETTERS TO ATTICUS Xll. 14

refuse. But see Septimius, Laenas and Statilius.
· There must be three. However Laenas undertook
the whole matter for me.

You say you have been dunned by Junius. Well
anyhow Cornificius is rich enough to pay: but 1
should like to know when they say I went bail for
him, and whether it was for the father or the son.
Still for all that, do as you say, and see Cornificius’
agents and Appuleius the estate agent.

You are as kind as usual in wishing that 1 could
get some relief from my grief ; but you can bear
witness that it is no fault of mine. For every word
that has been written by anyone on the subject of
assuaging grief Ι read at your house. But my
sorrow is beyond any consolation. Why, I have
done what no one has ever done before, tried to
console myself by writing a book. 1 will send it
to you as soon as it is copied out. Ι assure you
no other consolation equals it. 1 write the whole
day long, not that it does any good, but it acts as
a temporary check: not very much of that, for
the violence of my grief is too strong; but still 1
get some relief and try with all my might to attain
some composure of countenance, if not of mind.
In so doing sometimes 1 think Ι am doing wrong,
and sometimes that 1 should be doing wrong, if
l were not to do it. Solitude helps a little, but it
would have much more effect, if you at any rate
could be with me: and that is my only reason
for leaving, for the place is as right as any could
be under the circumstances. However even the
idea of seeing you upsets me: for now you can
never feel the same towards me. I have lost all
you used to love.

1 have mentioned Brutus’ letter to me before:
