LETTERS TO ATTICUS XV. 3

the case is not the same, nor is the occasion the same,
as in the proceedings which you recall to my memory
as taking place in the temple of Apollo in the con-
sulship of Lentulus and Marcellus :1 especially as you
say Marcellus and others are leaving Rome. So when
we meet we must scent out the facts and settle
whether we can be safe at Rome. The inhabitants
of the new community² trouble me a good deal, for
Ι am in considerable difficulties. But these are small
matters: I am treating even more important things
than this with contempt. I know Calva’s will. How
disgracefully mean! Ι am grateful to you for attend-
ing to Demonicus' sale. About . . . Ι wrote to Dola-
bella long ago very fully, if only my letter was
delivered. In his interests I am keen and devoted.

1 come to your more recent letter. I have learned
all I want about Alexio. Hirtius is devoted to you.
With Antonius I wish things were going even worse
than they are. About young Quintus, as you say,
assez. About his father we will speak when we meet.
I want to assist Brutus in every way that is possible.
I see you have the same opinion of his harangue as Ι
have. But I don’t quite understand why you want
me to write a speech attributing it to Brutus, when
he has published his own. How could that be proper?
Should 1 write as though against a tyrant justly
executed? I shall have much to say and much to
write, but in another way and at another time. Well
done the tribunes about Caesar's chair, and well done
the famous fourteen rows of equites! I am glad
Brutus stayed at my house, and I only hope he
enjoyed himself and stayed a long time.
