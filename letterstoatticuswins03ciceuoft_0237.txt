LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 2—1}

Ι am thinking of going to Tusculum to-day, to
Lanuvium temon-ow, and then to Astura. Ι am
ready to entertain Pilia, though I should like
Attica. However‚ Ι forgive you. So greet me to

them both.

exemto To ATTtCUS, GRssETlNG.

Your letter is full of peace, and Ι only hope peace Tusculum,
may last some time. Matius does not think it can. April 9, 13.c.
Here are my builders, who had gone off harvest· 44
ing, returning empty-handed and bringing a strong
report that all the corn is being taken to Antony’s
house at Rome. of course it is a false alarm, orI
should have heard it from you. Not a sign as yet of
Balbus' man Corumbus. Ι know the name; he is
said to be a good architect.

It appears to me there was reason in their asking
you to be present at the sealing of that will: for
they want us to think them friendly, and Ι don't see
why that should not be their real feeling. But what
does it matter to us? However‚ scent out Antony's
intentions; I fancy he is more eoncemed about his
banquets than about plotting any harm.

If you have any news of practical importance, let
me hear it; if not, give me full details as to who
were cheered by the people at the mimes, and the
epigrams of the actors. My love to Pilia and Attica.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETlNG.

Do you suppose Ι get any news at Lanuvium? But Lanuvium,
I suspect you hear something fresh every day in town. April 10,
The trouble is coming to a headx for when Matius ac. 44

thinks so, what do you suppose others think? ngssaf ἱ
