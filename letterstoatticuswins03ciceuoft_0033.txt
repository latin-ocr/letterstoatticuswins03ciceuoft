LETTERS To ATTICUS XII. 6-62

Tyrannio. Do you really mean it?1 How unfair,
without me! Think how often, even when 1 had
plenty of time, Ι refused without you. How are
you going to atone for your crime then? There
is only one way: you must send me the book. 1
earnestly entreat you to do so; though the book
itself will not delight me more than your admiration
of it has. For I love everyone who loves learning
and Ι am glad you admired so strongly an essay on
so minute a point. But that is you all over. Yon
want knowledge, which is the only mental food.
But please tell me what there was in that acute and
grave treatise which contributed to your summum
bonum.

However I'm making a long story of it, and you
may be busy about some of my business. And in
return for that dry basking in the sun, in which you
revelled in my meadow, I shall claim from you a
richer and a warmer glow.2 But to return to my
first point. If you love me, send me the book: for
it is yours of course, as it was sent to you.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

“ What, so much leisure from your own affairs ”⁸ Tusculum,
that you have found time to read the Orator too. interculta-y
Bravo! l am pleased to hear it, and shall be still mouth, uc,
more pleased if you will get your copyists to alter 46
Eupolis to Aristophanes ⁴ not only in your own copy
but in others too. Caesar seemed to me to be amused

not very clear. Probably he only means that he is expecting
to enjoy Atticus’ hospitality soon.

⁸ Terence, Heaut. 75.

⁴ In the quotation from Aristophanes, Aah. 530, in Orac. 29.
