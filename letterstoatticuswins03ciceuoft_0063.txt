LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS XII. 21-22

In calling me back to the forum, you call me to a
place I shunned even in my happy days. What
have Ι to do with a forum, where there are no law-
courts, no Senate, and where people are continually
obtruding themselves on my sight, whom 1 cannot
endure to see? You say people are demanding my
presence at Rome, and will not allow me to be
absent, or at any rate only for a certain time. Rest
assured that Ι have long held you at a hig-her value
than them all. Myself too Ι do not underrate, and
Ι far prefer to trust my own judgment than that of
all the rest. However 1 am not going further than
the wisest heads allow. Ι have not only read all
their writings on the point, which in itself shows
1 am a brave invalid and take my medicine, but I
have transferred them to my own work3 and that
certainly does not argue a mind crushed and en-
feebled. Do not call me back from these remedies
into that busy life, for fear l relapse.

you can do. You and you only can see what is
fair. About Rutilia, as you seem to have doubts,
write and let me know as soon as you know, but let
that be as soon as possible : and also whether Clodia
survived her son D. Brutus the ex-consul. The
latter you can find out from Marcellus, οι· at any
