LETTERS TO ATTICUS XII. 26-27

knowing what your business is. 1 have no doubt of
your wish, or rather your eager desire, to be with
me. You mention Nicias.l If Ι were in a condition
to enjoy his cultivated conversation, he is one of the
first persons Ι should wish to have with me. But
solitude and retirement are my proper sphere ε and
it is because Sicca can content himself with that,
that I am the more eager for his visit. Besides you
know how delicate our Nicias is, andhis luxurious
way of living. So why should Ι want to put him to
inconvenience‚ when he cannot give me any pleasure ?
However 1 am grateful to him for wishing it. There
is one point you wrote about, which 1 have made up
my mind not to answer. For I hope Ι have pre-
vailed upon you to relieve me from the burden.²
My greetings to Pilia and Attica.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTlcus, GREETlNG.

As to the business with Silius, I know the tex-ms Astura,
well enough, butI expect to hear full details from March 23,
Sicca to-day. Cotta’s place, which you say you don't ue. 45
know, is beyond Silius' house, which Ι think you
know. It is a shabby little house and very tiny,
with no ground, and not big enough for anything
' except the purpose for which Ι require it. Ι am
looking for a public position. But, if the matter is
being settled about Silius' gardens,—that is, if you
settle it, for it rests entirely with you—there is no
reason for thinking of Cotta.

About my son Ι will do as you say. I will leave

² Cicero refers to the arrangement with Terentia for the
repayment of her dowry. 57
