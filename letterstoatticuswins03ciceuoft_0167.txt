LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIII. 22

XXII

CICERO ΤΟ A'r'rlcus, GREETlNG.

Ι have my reasons for asking so persistently for Arpinum,
your opinion about Varro. Some objections occur July 4,
to me; but of those when we meet. Your name Ι ac. 45
introduced with the greatest pleasure and Ι shall do
so more frequently, for 1 see for the first time from
your last letter that you do not disapprove. About
Marcellus Cassius had already written to me, and
Servius sent some details.1 What a sad thing! I
return to my former point. There are no hands in
which I would rather have my writings than in yours,
but I should prefer them not to leave your hands till
we have agreed on it. 1 aequit your copyists of
fault and I bring no charge against y0u; but there
was something different that I did mention in a
letter, that Caerellia had some things she could only
have got from you. In Balbus’ case I realize of
course that you had to satisfy him; only 1 am sorry
that Brutus should get anything stale or Balbus
anything unfinished. I will send to Varro, as soon
as Ι have seen you, if you agree. Why I have
hesitated, you shall know, when Ι (10 see you.

Istrongly appi-ove of your calling in those debts
which have been transferred to me. 1 am sorry
you are being bothered about Ovia's estate. About
Brutus it is a great nuisance, but such is life. The
ladies, however, are not very considerate in being
annoyed, though both of them observe the pro-

granted him permission to return to Rome, an event celebrated
in Cicero's speech Pro Marcello. Servius’ letter is preserved,
Ad Fam. 1v. 12, and gives full details of the murder. Cf.
