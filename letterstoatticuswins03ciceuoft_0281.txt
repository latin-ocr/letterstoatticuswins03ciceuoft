LETTERS To ATTICUS XIV. 17

that everything seems to depend on chance. So
these points we will discuss on the spot when we
meet. As regards the business about Buthrotum
Ι only wish 1 could meet Antony. I am sure
1 could make good headway with him. But people
think he won’t stir from Capua, and Ι fear his going
there will do a great deal of harm to the state.
L. Caesar, whom Ι saw yesterday very ill at Naples,
thought the same too. So Ι shall have to handle
this subject and get it settled on the lst of June.
But enough of this.

Young Quintus has sent his father a most un-
pleasant letter, which was delivered when we
reached Pompeii. The chief point of it was that
he would not put up with Aquilia as a step-mother:
but that perhaps is excusable. But to say he owed
everything to Caesar, nothing to his father, and for
the future he looked to Antonius-what a scoundrel !
However that shall be attended to.

Ι have written to Brutus, to Cassius and to
Dolabella. I send you copies; not that I am in
doubt whether to send the letters or not; for 1
feel sure that they ought to be sent, and Ι have
no doubt you will agree with me.

Please, dear Atticus, supply my boy with as much
money as you think fit, and forgive me for troubling
you. For what you have done already I am most
grateful. That unpublished book of mine1 Ι have
not yet polished up as Ι should wish: the points
you want me to introduce must wait for a second
volume. But I think—and Ι hope you will believe
me—that one could have spoken against that dis-
reputable party with less danger in the tyrant's

¹ Possibly his poem De temporibus sui8; but it is not

certain.
