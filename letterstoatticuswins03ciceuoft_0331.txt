LETTERS To ATTICUS XV. 6-7

have been taken for so many years. 1 wish you
could obtain a promise from Brutus and Cassius, not
to enter upon any hot-headed scheme, as easily as
you can from me. For you say they wrote what you
mention when on the point of leaving the country.
Whither and why? Stop them, Ι beg you, Cicero,
and do not let everything go to rack and ruin. For
upon my honour things are already being upset by
rapine, fire, and slaughter. [f they have any sear,
let them take some precaution merely, and not make
any fresh move. Upon my honour they will not ac-
complish any more by violent measures than they
will by quiet, provided they are careful. The present
unsettled state of affairs cannot last long in the nature
of things; if there is a struggle and they are here,
they have power to do much harm. What your hopes
for them are, write and tell me at Tusculum.'’

There is Hirtius' letter. 1 answered, affirming that
they had no hot-headed scheme. 1 wanted you to
know this for what it is worth.

Just as Ι had scaled this Balbus writes to me that
Servilia has returned, and avers that they will not
leave Italy. Now I look for a letter from you.

me much pleasure, especially that of our friend May 28 or
Sextus. You will say, “Because he praiscs you.” 29, Rc, 44
Upon my word Ι think that is part of the reason:
but even before I got to that passage I was very
much pleased both by his sentiments on politics and
hy his style. Servius the peacemaker with a nobody,
