LETTERS TO ATTICUS XIV. 13a

Ι petitioned Caesar for the return of Sex. Clodius,
and obtained my request. It was my intention even
then only to use his favour if you allowed. So Ι am
now the more anxious that you may let me do it
with your permission. But, if you show yourself
hard-hearted to his affliction and misery, 1 will not
contend with you, though Ι think Ι ought to observe
Caesar's memoranda. But upon my word, if you are
ready to take a generous, philosophical, and amiable
view of my actions, you will, 1 am sure, show your
indulgence, and will wish that most promising youth,
P. Clodius, to think that you did not act spitefully
to his father's friends when you had the chance. I
beseech you to let it seem that your feud with his
father was on public grounds, not because you de-
spised the family. For we can lay aside quarrels we
took up on public grounds with more honour and
more readiness than those that come from a persona]
insult. So give me a chance of inculcating this lesson,
and while the boy’s mind is still receptive, let us
convince him that quarrels should not be handed
down from generation to generation. Though Ι
know your fortune, Cicero, is above any danger,
yet I think you would rather enjoy old age with
peace and honour than with anxiety. F inally Ι
feel a right to ask you this favour, for Ι have done
all 1 could for your sake. If I do not gain it, I
shall not grant Clodius his restoration, so that you
may understand how much your authority weighs
in my eyes, and that may make you all the more
placable.
