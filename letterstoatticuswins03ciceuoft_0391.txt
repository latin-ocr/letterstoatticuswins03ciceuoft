LETTERS TO ATTICUS XVI. 2

Brutus was pleased with your letter. 1 spent
several hours with him at Nesis, just after I received
your letter. He seemed to be delighted at the Te-
reus incident, and to feel more grateful to Accius
than to Antonius} For my part the better the news
is, the more it annoys and pains me, that the Roman
people use their hands not for defending the consti·
tution but for clapping. It seems to me that the>
Caesarian party is possessed of a positive mania for
parading its disloyalty. However, “so they but
suffer, be it what it will.'’ ²

You say my plan is daily more commended. 1 am
not sorry, and 1 am looking forward to anything you
may say about it. For 1 have met with various
opinions ; and, indeed, for that reason 1 am hesitating
as long as possible before committing myself. But
since Ι am being turned out with a pitchfork, Ι arn
thinking of Brundisium. For it seems to me to be
more certain and easier to avoid the soldiers than
the pirates, who are said to be in evidence.

Ι expected Sestius on the loth, but he has not
come, so far as I know. Cassius has arrived with his
little fleet. When I have seen him,I am thinking
of going on the llth to Pompeii, and thence to
Aeculanum. You know the rest. About Tutia, that
is what 1 thought. As for Aebutius, Ι don't believe
it3 nor do Ι care any more than you do. I have
written of course to Plancus and Oppius, as you
asked me ε but, if you think better of it, don’t hold
yourself bound to deliver the letters. For, since
they have done it all for your sake, Ι fear my· letters

favourable to Brutus, but Appius, B. 0. 111. 24, states that
outbursts against Caesar’s assassins drove them to decide on
leassvffrffidxtagiyranius. Cf. Cicero, Tusa. Disp. 1v. 45 and 55. V
